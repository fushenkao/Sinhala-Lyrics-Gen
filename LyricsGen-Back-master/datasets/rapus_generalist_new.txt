Chickens in the sink
Crack on the stove
Triple beam for the weight
Cut the middle man tryna get 8 white bitches
Snorting off the plate coke from Colombia
Riding round in the Benz looking like a trap star
Flipping raw day and night
Tryna get my money right naw I ain't living rite
Fucking bitches all night kick 'em out the next day
Everyday is pay day
Hit me with a half bring it back in two days
Living in Califronia by the ocean
Condo got em open
Long dick stroke em
I send 'em to the husband he over there fussing
I'm over here fucking no loving
Slim pants ripped jeans Jeremy Scott wings
Fucking heavily counting up cream
Rolling on beans disobedient with trees
Tatted from neck to ear bitches they want to stare
Macking with hoes as I pose
Hand in my draws henny out my pores
As I pour hit the blunt too much you on the dash as I pass

Different money different days
On my hip I got that cake
Close your mouth if it ain't about 'caine
Over the stove mixing
Hitting swishers
Red paint tripping blue seat sack tripping
Coke I hold tripping
I'm pimping hat tilting
No limping fuck sipping
I'm shitting on you niggas
Seven figures go figure
Surrounded by white bitches
Slipping off wedding rings
She do her one two thing
Cali with the pool in the back
Got these niggas backs
Meet me by the border ounce to a key
Flying over seas
Korean imported extorted these niggas
Smoking out the bong
Lighting up the spliff Basel on my wrist
Bought me a six pop the willy on that bitch
She snorting off my dick put her on the strip
Flipping my bread triple my spread nigga bring it back
Triple my racks bricks in my backpack
What up to Troy Ave
Still pouring up deuce in the triple cup
Purple lean or that yellow tuss

Do my thing let my nuts hang
Girls come back like boomerangs
Pretty flowers whens it spring
But fall off when its winter time
Sip Henny not wine boy get on your death rhyme
Make a milli off one rhyme pass the mic ima shine
Got my shit on rewind cold white bitches from the show
Mosh Pit better watch the toes airplane on leather floors
Tell the pilot where to go dark tints lay low

Mossberg shotty saying get back

Niggas hold they fam out
Panamera is blacked out
Paper chase might pass out
Niggas change my peso
God love ya' haters

Playing for the Lakers faster than a Maverick
Niggas hustle backwards  four five give you static

Smoking on purple Randy Moss
Shrimp calamari tomato sauce
Never ever thinking of Santa Claus
Mama workin' her ass off

Hands on my nuts saying Fuck the Law
Everything I spit no cut all raw

Can't understand you my dick in your throat
Balls in your mouth and your hands on my coat
Don't need you touching me I might go broke
Don't need you fucking me you not that dope

If you keep on popping its popping outside
Give me a reason to scare you tonight
Act like yo' ass got some sense

Before they end up in a meeting with the bottom of my temp
Itty bitty niggas need to mind they fucking bitches
Before I tell your little wifey you as public as connects 
Send that bitch off

Hoes around the corner got the line packed
Balenciaga mix it with the Stone
You don't know that's designer clothes
Rolls Royce on Melrose

Might just fuckin' leave it might just fuckin' leave it
If I fuck you baby can you keep a secret
Sipped a whole pint woke up in the evening
Forty cal hit him now his sneakers leanin'

Yea gotta watch em 'cause these hoes be cheating
Gotta watch em 'cause these hoes be eating dick
You know Benji rock out like The Beatles
Chop the top off my AMG I'm switching lanes
I fell in love with these demons that's all in my brain
Xanny bar in my blood stream can't feel no pain
Hit Magic City with this 50 I'm gon' make it rain
Shoot up his whole block test out my aim
They like Addie spit that raw flow
To perform in coke and white bitches flow
Still spendin' coke and white bitches though
Just copped the whip and it go skirt
Bitch nigga go to Bloomingdales need a skirt
Catch a bitch nigga lacking hop out merked
I'm in the streets fuck a nigga's network
Chanel store rack out buy mom's a purse

They like Addie spit that raw flow
To perform in coke and white bitches flow
Still spendin' coke and white bitches though
Just copped the whip and it go skirt
Bitch nigga go to Bloomingdales need a skirt
Catch a bitch nigga lacking hop out merked
I'm in the streets fuck a nigga's network
Chanel store rack out buy mom's a purse
Broke niggas always hating now they catch me slipping
Murder scene was crazy
Like the dope O.G. Backwood blazing
Poppin' Xan dirty Fanta feel amazing
got a bitch Asian
bitches fell in love temptations
Sit back be cool and stay patient
When your time come boy better take it
Rent don't work catch me chilling in a vacant
Need a White five-fifty Benz Ronald Reagan
From Baltimore where the murder's raising
Passing out T's in the morning fiends shaking
Don't give a fuck about an internet comment
Someday's want to say Fuck this rap shit
But real grown men never ever quit
Dj Nick son bro we came lit
I pimp my own brown work 
Steady striving hard work pay off at the end
Hard work pay off at the end 
YG's in this bitch Diego Addie

I'm a young god muhfucka
Might reach the stars muhfucka
Bought to buy a fresh car muhfucka

Niggas think I'm famous
'Cause I'm getting rap money up the anus
I'm Andy Warhol for the raps
But I don't do no painting
Just got the  nickname Satan
Grind like Tony Hawk thumbing through the checks
But no skating
Everybody talking bout cashing out niggas be faking

You had a juice now you dried up now nigga you a raisin

Trapping hard and hitting licks bitch we hood famous
Ride the plug and took his bricks so now we hood famous
Can't leave the house without my stick nigga

Swear it's all fun and games how somebody get dropped
All fun and games how somebody get shot

Tryna' take my niggas off that block
Gettin' dope money gettin' shows for the bread
Wanna put it put it right in my head
Boutta' have a in my life through a kid
Free my nigga that's throwin' the bed
Came a long way from smokin' the 
Look at the cup see the lean that's purple
Look at the percs of the pill that's pink
Cruisin' in traffic blowin' on dank
On three drugs at one time
Cruisin' the traffic duckin' one time
Better get some money fuck door crimes
Speaking my music from my rhymes
Pops always told me you gotta have a grind

It's all fun and games how somebody get hit
Run up on the scene clear the whole damn strip
Pussy with the percs had a whole damn script

He gon' see first place no matter what it take

Money in my pocket that a make you niggas frown
Bad bitch around and you know she going down 
It's all fun and games how somebody get shot
And I cleared the whole scene 'cause my chopper hold a lot

If findin' somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring your girls to the crib maybe we can solve it

Hold up bitches simmer down
Takin' hella long bitch give it to me now
Make that thing pop like a semi or a 9
Ooh baby like it raw with the shimmy
Never met a motherfucker fresh like me
All these motherfuckers wanna dress like me
Put the chrome to your dome make you sweat like Keith
'Cause I'm the nigga the nigga like how you figure
Gettin' figures and fuckin' bitches
She rollin' Swishers brought her bitches
I brought my niggas they gettin' bent up off the liquor
She love my licorice I let her lick it
They say money make a nigga act niggerish
But least a nigga  rich
I be fuckin' broads like I be fuckin' bored
Turn a dyke bitch out have her fuckin' boys beast

I know you love it when this beat is on
Make you think about all of the niggas you've been leadin' on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feedin' on
Got a feelin' that's the same dudes that we speakin' on
Oh word Ain't heard my album Who you sleepin' on 
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin' read-along
Ain't a fuckin' sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju 
Then just drop down and get yo' eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head then motherfucker get to bustin'
Yes Lord I don't really say this often
But this long-dick nigga ain't for the long talkin' I'm beast

If findin' somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring your girls to the crib maybe we can solve it

Uh yeah ho this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she from the hood but she live inside in the valley now
Vaca'd in Atlanta then she goin' back to California
Got your girl on my line world on my line
The irony I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a nigga don't exist
Girl I know you want this dick
Girl I'm Kendrick Lamar
A.K.A. Benz is to me just a car
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow
kill 'em all dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved listen what the crystal ball say
 
If findin' somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring your girls to the crib maybe we can solve it
Ah feelin' like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetery with obituaries
Don't be scared nigga is you ready 
I've been thinkin' 'bout all the O's in my bank account 
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount 
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out huh
Young boy let his gun bang let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling

We outlawed then I bogart any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag get broke off in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like fuck I hate y'all
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold my K hot your 9 cold that bark like K9's on
That banana clip straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say RIP I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must have froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face I might snap I might choke ya
Spine right out of place give me dap like you 'posed ta
Darts at your posters dark nights like this
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff

Barely even conscious talkin' to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict don't drop bars I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias
The violence and the killin' so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o' clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail but when I preach I only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga wish you the best for real

When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter any fuckin' rapper fuck it
Painter skater musician trailer-park dirt-ditch-diggin'
Burger-flippin' eat sleep shittin' human bein' you would be in
Trouble to body double or couple me to these others
'Cause comparatively speakin' my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians new beginnin' again
You in school at ten late Radioactive's goin' gold
And so Great Do I give a flying duck 
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us 
Alabama's climbin' up wait no I don't give a
Motherfuck your life pussy blood clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show Yelawolf

Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy 'cause I'm high like Michael Jackson penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun barefoot with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch when I say this I mean this Ho I'm the meanest
Dick so big it's like from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous aw shit no off switch
That is my synopsis ostrich's posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit stop it You not this 
Novice regardless heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest tell me isn't that ironic 

Swiftly I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon's reflection off the lake hit me
You should have stayed with me now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the mornin' on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin' drinkin' Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin' I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scramblin' sellin' Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn this shit tastes like fantastic uh
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist I've got the briefcase
The gavel slam I'm a free man try not to eat ham

Spit like my last breath casket rap six deep
Eyes closed the black is back out come the 'lac with flats
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch
All I had was rap when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love and all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes a championship win is
The aftermath ask LeBron open palm slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank I've been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label I'm taxin' if you want a hit
Clear fuck your career bitch I was born here
Get the fuck from 'round here that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin' grain fuckin' hoes candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my soul how could you ever doubt me 
Most rappers hopin' the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B. B. King saw the king in me so why can't you 
In order to come up close you'll have to dig up Cash and Elvis too
 
Muddy water flow Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag poppin' benji tags on your wifey's ass
That's out of line but in livin' color 
I'm more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers a true artist
I said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

Let's take it to the basis you in the midst of greatness
My Martin was a Maison rocked Margielas with no laces
Cristal go by the cases wait hold up that was racist
I would prefer the Aces ain't no different when you taste it
A forty ounce to chase it that's just a understatement
I'm early to the party but my 'Rari is the latest
Somehow it seems girls in they late teens
Remind me your favorite jeans 'cause they naked 'cause you famous
Life's a mothafucka ain't it These other rappers ain't us
So tell me what your name is I'mma tell it to my stainless
You aim it before you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
It's just me myself and I and mothafuckas that I came with
Miscellaneous niggas wanna hate on me
Until I tell 'em to they face they ain't no G
Low key niggas mad 'cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass

I said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

Yes I'm the shit tell me do it stink 
It feel good wakin' up some money in the bank
Three model bitches cocaine on the sink
And I'm so 'bout it 'bout it I might roll up in a tank
'Cause my chain came from Cuba got a lock up on the link
And them red bottom loafers just to complement the mink
Eyes chink rollin' up that dank blowin' on that stank
What you mean Tell me what you drink I'm on that kissin' pink
You could call me Billy Gates got a crib in every state
Man on the moon got a condo out in space
Open up your legs tell me how it taste
And them niggas talkin' shit so tell 'em fuck you
Tell that bitch hop up on my dick rolled up on her quick
In a six told her suck a dick motorboat her tits
I'm the shit niggas mad 'cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig-Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass

I said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off
Wake up feeling blessed up pistol on that dresser
Ain't afraid to show it I'll expose it if I dress up
Riding in that Testarossa nigga catch up
Sipping on that syrup 'til I'm messed up like yes sir
So now I'm getting change people looking at me strange
Like nigga switching lanes never changed still the same
We fuck bitches get paper you fuck niggas on papers
We walk around with lasers you prolly own some tasers
Lame niggas disgrace us they girlfriends want date us
Got different hoes I'm pimping hoes you could tell by my paystubs
My niggas gettin' right smokin' weed with dirty Sprite
Going wild for the night fuck being polite I'm goin'

Finna wild out for the weekend me myself and I my three friends
Nigga feeling froggy then leap in A$AP niggas finna sneak in
Middle finger to the critics me and my nigga Skrillex
You know we finna kill it A$AP we the trillest
You don't really want that Glock boy
You don't really wanna feel them shots boy
You a b-boy I'm a block boy I'm a D boy I'm a hot boy
Six shots got me feelin' like Pac boy party all night shit don't stop boy
Drunk as fuck and I'm ready to fight
Wilding for the night fuck being polite boy

Wild for the night fuck being polite I'm going

It's the weekend and I'm creeping with my niggas
Drunk and disrespectful callin' women bitches
I don't mean no harm but won't you and your friends
Meet us in the cut and we can do the business
God my witness that I only wanna kick it
And your girl just said they with us
So we rolling in them Benzes
Won't you pour it up and stop the babysitting
She got drunk as fuck and swallowed all my kids

Back to the Mac tats on her back
Ass so fat hit that from the back
When it clap from the back she clappin' it back
She flat on her back and it's back to the trap
Fuck your pack A$AP where it's at
Fuck nigga act get clap lay flat
Fuck your dreams leave a punk nigga dreamin'
Then you sleep and you won't come back from the nap
Benjamin Three-Stack it's a fact she lives in my lap
On my Outkast daddy fat bitches on my sack
And you know them smokin' bitches rolling reefer got me open
Wildin' to the morning with my homies tell 'em where we going

Wild for the night fuck being polite I'm going
I be that pretty mothafucka Harlem's what I'm reppin'
Tell my niggas quit the bitchin' we gon' make it in a second
Never disrespected plus I'm well connected
With this coke that I imported just important as your president
Swagger so impressive and I don't need a necklace
But these bitches get impressed when you pull up in that 7
Them 6's them Benzes I gets get the freshest
Raf Simons Rick Owens usually what I'm dressed in
Blowing blunts rolling doobies up smoking sections
Groupies rush hold they boobies up in my direction
Quit with all the fronting you ain't 'round my clique for nothing
'Cause our presence is a present just to kick it is a blessing

This is the way it goes this is the way we roll
'Cause every day we on our pesos

Your bitch just said I'm hot man I told her I agree
She gon' really think I'm hot if I told her my degrees
Pull up in that hard-top showing off my keys
Graduate school of hard-knocks I can show you my degrees
Couple A B C's bad bitch double D's
Popping E I don't give a F told you I'm a G
A.S.A.P. Stevie got it on his sleeve
But I got it on my chest my nigga this is what I breathe
Inhale exhale cocaine X pills
Import export Harlem catching rec still
So mami show me how that neck feel
Later show me how the rest feel for now just chill

This is the way it goes this is the way we roll
'Cause every day we on our pesos
 
'Cause every day we on our pesos
I thought I'd probably die in prison expensive taste in women
Ain't had no pot to piss in now my kitchen full of dishes
Nose bloody from that sniffin' your heroin addiction
Trigger finger itching fuck parental supervision
This be that murder business little Timmy got that semi
I ain't kidding hide yo kittens hit yo children with that Smith and
A bunch of ignant little niglets hard headed never listen
Purple sippin' finger twistin' teeth glisten like it's Memphis
A bunch of hypocritic Christians the land of no religion
My Santa Claus was missing catch you slippin' then it's Christmas
Motherfuck a wishlist my ghetto was ambition
For my benjis and my Bentley and them bitches now I get them
On the road to riches a diamond ring designer jeans
Choking on that biscuit till I'm no longer existing
I wonder if they miss me as long as I make history
Now my soul is feeling empty tell the reaper come and get me

Who said you can't live forever lied
Of course I'm living forever I'll
Forever I'll live long
You can't ever deny
My force I'm living forever I'll
Forever I'll live

Riding through your city like that motherfucka mine
Or choking on that semi rob a motherfucka blind
License plate says wipe me down car from ninety-nine
But a nigga sits so pretty call that motherfucker fine
Lost your motherfucking mind what's on your mind niggas talking down
Never talk to cops make him talk to God when I tote that 9 he ain't talking now
Tell 'em watch your spine I mean watch your back
Better guide your track better not look back
Now stay in line don't step on cracks
So you break her back I'm talking 'bout your mom
'Cause there's killers in my town making hits sniffing lines
Out committing crimes wait for shit to simmer down
Corrupted little minds 8 and 9 finna shine
On the grind do you dirty with that shimmy
Where they shoot without a purpose services 'n hearses
Kids who ain't deserve it can't survive a thing you're worthless
Strangers make me nervous who's that peekin' in my window with a pistol to my curtains 

Pretty nigga rich Flacko be the shit
And that bitch know we poppin' so she boppin' on this dick
Nigga R.I.P. to Pimp can't forget Little Flip
And I take it out to Memphis so shout out to Triple Six

Rocking rolling swagging to the max
My bitch a fashion killa she be busy popping tags
She got a lotta Prada that Dolce and Gabbana
I can't forget Escada and that Balenciaga
I'm sipping purple syrup come be my Aunt Jemima
And if you is a rider we'll go shopping like manana
Her attitude Rihanna she get it from her mama
She jiggy like Madonna but she trippy like Nirvana
'Cause everything designer her jeans is Helmut Lang
Shoes is Alexander Wang and her shirt the newest Donna
Karan wearing all the Cartier frames
Jean Paul Gaultier 'cause they match with her persona

I see your Jil Sanders Oliver Peoples
Costume National your Ann Demeuelemeester
See Visvim be the sneaker Lanvin or Balmain
Goyard by the trunk her Isabel Marant
I love your Linda Farrow I adore your Dior
Your Damir Doma Vena Cava from the store
I crush down with that top down bossy see how I ride 'round
Mami in that Tom Ford Papi in that Thom Browne
Rick Owens Raf Simons boy she got it by the stock
She ball until she fall that means she shop 'til she drop
And Versace got a lot but she may never wear it
But she save it so our babies will be flyer than their parents

Scoop back tees breeze in coupe
Smiling is your treasure you're so well put together
Bags and links jeans and shoes
Spikes and patent leathers different fabrics mixed together
Go away together we could get away forever
All emotions clashing thrashing someone turn the light out
I met my baby expressed my passion on my fashion night out

Off again there he go to another dimension my mind
Body soul imprisoned my eye prolly goin' ballistic but listen
I'm missin' a couple of screws they ain't never do drillin' true
You been sippin' away at the truth a double shot of wisdom'll do
Do do rollin' through hittin' switches
Rolling ditches blowin' kisses to the bitches holdin' biscuits
What's the business Beat the system
Co-defendants blow the sentence go to prison
Go to church and pray the father Lord forgive us 
And only God can judge me  and he don't like no ugly
I look so fuckin' good most dykes'll fuck me buddy
Yeah I'm a piece of shit I know I plead the fifth
I tell her if ya need some dick you can call me
The devotion is gettin' hopeless but hold it I'm gettin' close
As my soul is I'm seein' ghosts a solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions adjustin' to the motions
And gettin' out all my emotions

Uh this type of shit
Make a nigga wanna flip September through August
This type of shit got 'em bustin' out the clip
In the middle of the office
And a message to the bosses
The Misfits' new outfit is on the bloglist
Gorgeous hoes keep on the sayin' that they caused it
'Cause the Porsches get 'em nauseous
Plus I ain't even mad yet niggas caught me in a good mood
Paparazzi wanna nag a nigga chillin' at the bag check
Hope they show me in my good shoes
When papa got the brand new bag
Flacko got the brand new Raf that's good news
Hood dudes usually don't look like you
How it feel to get a deal and come back
And the whole hood look like you
Can't drive bitch I'm legally blind bitch
If I live or die it's up to me to decide
Shit niggas coppin' guns like they legal to buy
The only key to survive and get a piece of the pie
Is to agree with a lot or just believe a facade bitch
And I'll be fine just-a drinkin' my wine bitch

So everyday I spend my time
Drinkin' wine feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I can understand yes I am
Everyday I spend my time
Drinkin' wine feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
I don't care if I ever know
Here I go here I go here I go 

I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more oh no
I'll be fine sippin' wine
I know I dream about her all day
I think about her with her clothes off
I'm ridin' 'round with my system bumpin' LSD
I look for ways to say I love you
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby I'm just rappin' to this LSD
She ain't a stranger to the city life
I introduced her to this hippy life
Girl I really fuckin' want love sex dream
Another quarter to the face system
Make no mistakes it's all a leap of faith for love
It takes a place in feelin' that you crave doin' love sex dreams

It started in Hollywood
Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue at a loss for words
'Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds
Held this feeling for way too long

I've been gettin' fly because the gimmick's so dope
I've been getting high 'cause I figured Lord told me
I've been drinking driving now we'll never go home
I gon' stay in doubt because the weather's so cold oh

It started in Hollywood
Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue at a loss for words
'Cause my feelings just said it all

I look for ways to say I love you
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby I'm just rappin' to this LSD
Who the jiggy nigga with the gold links 
Got me reminiscin' 'bout my old day
Three 6 suck a nigga dick no foreplay all day
Boomin' out the trap through the hallway
Tell me what you niggas know about it
Auntie sayin' turn it down or she finna call the cops
We be plottin' on the ops she the one who got the drop
Just a free quick fix of the A and it's okay
They gon' take me back to my old ways
I was tryna chill poppin' seals ever since I got a deal
Kick it with my model chick sip Cris fuck niggas wanna diss
Now I gotta let 'em know who's really trill

Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye
Tell these fuck niggas how you been
You been crossin' our minds niggas talk down every now and then
On the side who gave em style nine times out of ten
It was Flacko Jodye Flacko Jodye
Flacko Jodye Flacko Jodye

I ain't never lookin' for no handouts
Broke ass niggas never helpin' but they hands out
Find out where the fuck nigga live then we camp out
Screamin' fuck the world never catch me with my pants down
Always been a stand up guy I'd rather stand out
Raf Simons Stan Smith edition with my bands out
I'm the trillest one to do it since Pimp nigga hands down
If a nigga put his hands on me that's a man down
Trick what Pimps up hoes down whoa now
Slow down see they runnin' with my old style
Grow foul gold smile you ho now thuggin' with my old style
It's a shame how they low down
Dirty like Adidas on my sneaker feature uh
Trappin' through the speaker peep the beeper ringer uh
Turnin' off phones just to reach 'em gotta beep 'em
I'm a Lord motherfucker better greet him if you see him

Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye
Tell these fuck niggas how you been
You been crossin' our minds niggas talk down every now and then
Before the real niggas live fuck niggas won't multiply

Back in the buildin' sold crack in the livin' room
Niggas toetagged sold gats for a livin'
Doo rag keep a red or blue flag in the denim
One you be with be the one to shoot at ya in a minute
Come to Harlem if you never seen Baghdad
First place I seen a nigga sell crack at
Where the hustlers don't sleep take cat naps
Shorty with the shotty limpin' like he got a bad  back
Even in my will keep it real thuggin' in my field
'Til the day I peel keep it trill anything I feel
Youngins trained to kill aimin' bangin' steel and slangin' krill
She shake it all for Satan just to paint her nails and pay her bills
I ain't really fuckin' with that Been Trill
Swear them niggas booty like Tip Drill
Nah I ain't really into throwin' shots
But these mothafuckas better give me my props word to Pac
We're the reason that these niggas gettin' throwed
Reason why you niggas wearin' gold
Jail pose in the pictures prayin' fingers to your nose
I remember if Pimp was alive he'd tell these hoes and these niggas

Even in my will keep it trill to the day I peel
When the real niggas die fake niggas gon' multiply
When all the real niggas die fake niggas gon' multiply

I'm the original Balmain badass nigga
I'm the original Margiela madman in the words of A$AP Yams
Smack the shit out a nigga in these skinny pants feel me 
Don't get it fucked up nigga we been jiggy been pretty
Still tell a bitch suck my dick swag nigga

Fuck with a nigga like me RIP my nigga Pimp C
Shit is weak you can keep that
Shit I might fuck around and bring the Jeep back
No doors on it flexin' with the seat back
Boy with the G pack might fuck around and bring the mink back

I'm the motherfuckin' Lord of this fashion shit
Don't I deserve just to brag a bit 
Set the blueprint fuck your two cents
Number 1 stunner ask Tumblr if I'm accurate
My motherfuckin' swag is immaculate
Plus I got enough style just to mack your bitch
I think back to when pockets packin' lint
It's like a nigga got rich on accident
Now back to Pimp bitches lie killers never lie
Triggers on the side by side bet I'm down to ride
Prosper said let's ride to the sky call it catastrophic
We don't ever die we just multiply bitch

Bloody ink on my pad spelled suicide
Michael Jackson even passed 'cause you scrutinized
Fuck illuminati lies say I'm lucified
Baptised in the gutter motherfucker you decide
'Cause the ride come with doors that be suicide
Or the thighs on my whores they be super-sized
Good and bad having wars nigga choose a side
Now all hail to the Lord like you do to God
Who am I Lord Flacko
Painting vivid pictures call me Basquiat Picasso
Capo Head Hancho now my following's colossal
Ain't no boxer Pacquiao but got the chopper todo caso
It's like you heard God spoke I seen the ghetto gospel
The choir like my reefer and the preacher got my eyes low
Sister Mary Jane to make me sleep from singing high notes
The bible or the rifle goodnight folks

Bloody ink on my pen spelled suicide
Kurt Cobain even died 'cause you scrutinize
It's a fine line between truth and lies
Jesus Christ never lied still was crucified
That's why I never judge another nigga
Life's a bitch but that bitch in love with other niggas
3 to a bed sheets no covers nigga
Dirty kitchen no supper in the cupboards nigga
Sucker niggas wassup with niggas
I grew up with niggas but don't fuck with niggas
I don't trust them niggas ain't got no love for niggas
Had the gold grills shining like them southern niggas
Kept it trilla now the whole world fuckin' with us
Meanwhile you treated all of us like other niggas
Now your world is in my palm take cover niggas

If I shall ever fall Lord pick me up
Ever since a baby two deuce in sippy cups
Ever since them diapers and my zip-me-ups
Now I'm walking on my own y'all wish me luck

It's all part of the plan
Yeah live through the strugglin' life's a every day 
I hustle every day in life thinkin' back
Takin' packs up the block them older niggas said I couldn't 
Man fuck 'em niggas I'll be back strapped backpack
Bitch I'm flippin' work hand in hand I think they call it track 
Racin' laps re-up went to waste it pays to make it stack
Face the fact there's always niggas out there tryin' to knock the 
I guess that's why they say we trap don't let niggas hold you back
I'm just a kettle from the ghetto with no pot to piss in
So who am I to call it  Black man black male
Black ball black opsy black diamonds glistenin'
Attract the pigs and all the rats kitten scratch
I went from roaches on my bump to red brooches on the cuff
Of my tux chauffeur pullin' up no if and's  or buts about him
I went to Paris for my trunks hundred thousand spent on Goyard
Used 'em once couldn't give a shit damn or fuck about 'em
Hit Canal Street vintage gold medallion
Smokin' blunts in front of public housin'
Wildin' 'til they throw me in them cuffs
Mouth full of fronts look like Master P up in my Cartiers
Diamonds shinin' in the frames
Changed the game and made them say 
Ain't no limits to this shit life's a flick you're stickin' to the script
My life is like a movie they should film me through it
Take a pic be sure to frame the shit forever me was always G
Way before this famous shit y'all just pretend to do it

You say you got them guns but I've never seen you bang
You say you got them drugs but I've never seen you slang
You say you in that game but I've yet to see you play
You say you going hard but nobody feels the same yeah

Rap game like the crack game swear it's all the same 
Whippin' soda through the pot watch it bubble
Flexin' muscle hit the block I bet I teach you niggas how to 
Sellin' coca on the charts watch it double
Uh takin' meetings on my bus this shit my mobile office
Gettin' head while at my desk this shit my oval office
I remember when I got a hundred for recordings
Now the sum of my performances just put me on the Forbes list
Fuck jiggy I'm flawless fuck pretty I'm gorgeous
Your favorite rappers' corpses couldn't measure my importance
My mind is out in orbits plus my ego got endorsements
Heard the people want that raw shit but y'all be talkin' bullshit

You say you got them guns but I've never seen you bang
You say you got them drugs but I've never seen you slang
You say you in that game but I've yet to see you play
You say you going hard but nobody feels the same yeah

Clipped-up like I'm paranoid high as hell nigga Fitzroy

Sold that bitch out should have made that ho bigger
Killing careers make these cupcakes remember

Biggie and Nas put they ass in a blender
Sprinkle some 50 and came out this nigga
Equipped with a gat and the dick in your mouth
Balls in my hands and your bitch in my house
Twisting up weed I'm digging her out

Riding 'round with that mask on like a Mac attack when that strap on

Blue pit in my back yard Red nose my bad broad
Titan full of that hydro Pretty nigga no catwalk
Big burner in your big mouth Pussy niggas suck lead off

Hands up stick your mans up your time's up the new brand's up Q 
Do just what I tell you

'Cause I don't know how long I can hold my heart in two

A rebel I be one day on that track with Gunplay
Outcast my whole life so I decide to spit like Andre
Beef is on my entree gin and juice that's Bombay
Driving fast the wrong way I swear life is like a one-way
Pussy on a Sunday business on a Monday
My new crib came with feng shui and my closet is like a runway
Come be my fiancee she fuck me in a Hyundai
My rooftop got a lounge just sit around and watch her sunbathe
Dinner date for one K shopping date for two K
Bougie-ass bitch made me wait to fuck for two days
Finally got it today swear to god my mood changed
Top off like toupees drop off touche

And my outfit was in Vogue I'm a pretty boy
Bounce boy Flacko tell 'em holla at a nigga G
Riding on my enemies this my ghetto symphony

Don't come in any closer

Whipping Whitney my mama as a witness
Bitches lickin' and locking up my swishas
Once she blow my whistle she know it's dismissal
Spread the news I'm official now hop out my foreign vessel
Before I get aggressive forget it war ready
Already tested tears and blood invested
Till my cardiac's arrested and my forty ounce is empty
Show me what you owe me and a porterhouse with that
Black magic on the tires only I
Rolling down a lonely mile phony smile
Warrants police on me now still tourin'
And my chain it may slow me down cheer for
Pain in its purest form
Don't complain I came to reign from here forward still noid
So crib got clear doors
Burning planes in my Air Force and all I can see is clear ports

Since Rocky spit like Andre I'm gon' kill 'em like Big Boi
These rappers is on my entree eat 'em like cookies Chips Ahoy
Mm enjoy when I get annoyed know a couple niggas that'll kill for joy
Either Gunplay runway trip avoid body get found by a lil' fishin' boy
Arnold Schwarzenigga toss a nigga

Slow punch make a nigga chin collide
That's for talking how fast you could grip a nine
Damn look how the hollow tip hit his spine
Little motherfuckers that commit the crime
These niggas got the sidewalk sipping wine
Guess that's why the ground sip the wine
Pouring liq so I soak in lift and shine
Tip tipped and toe I miss the sky
My soul gets cold when my niggas died
So and so niggas live and die
Beneath shoe soles you will reside
Rappers get a mil for these freakin' lies
Sign a couple deals for these freakin' lies
How many times in your eyes has a nigga died Never 
Spittin' it like a Beretta nobody do it better nigga
All I think about is life nights sipping on Sprite
Little codeine nigga get throwed right
Two blonde dykes wanna kiss all night
I just pray to God that the shit go right
Little argument and their fists don't fight

Damn how a young nigga get so nice 
Young nigga cold like he sitting on ice

Convincin' my bitch to go blonde
Was born in the dark I kill you
You open my blinds
On Yams and that's word to my moms
Margiela Madman with cases I'm still tryna beat
A bunch of shit from a long time ago
The bigger they are the harder they fall
Like dominos nigga Geronimos
When it's my time to go adios vamonos
Flacko no Dominicano but eat the tostones with platanos
Dealing with life and its highs and lows
I'm just pimpin' like I'm supposed
I guess it's called livin' shit I suppose
Ain't talkin' 'bout spending or buyin' clothes
I'm 'bout my business but I'm alone
I still had the vision when I was broke
Fuckin' on bitches and foreign hoes
Flyin' out womens to boring shows
I pray to God I don't overdose

I put New York on the map
I put the gang on the flames
They gon' remember the name
They robbin' boys for the chains
I got Goyard by the sack

But never truly lied at all then and now
They tryna front on the gang
Truth somehow
Gang A$AP boys come with the flame
In my dreams I'm dying all the time
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all
Then I wake it's kaleidoscopic mind
But never truly lied at all
But never truly lied at all then and now
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant to lie
See me in the hood the gangstas saying wassup 

Back once again sipping Henn mixed with juice and gin
Bitches in couple lady friends countin Benjamins
Spinners spin on the twnety-twins that Mercedes-Benz
Dividends made a change of plans well that all depends
Shout-out my parolees and I smoke that OG
Kush mothafuck the police all my niggas rock gold teeth
So hood and we so street sipping on that codeine
We hustle hard no sleep your bitch loose that's no leash
I ain't talking 'bout no money I ain't talking 'bout no cars
Talking 'bout no diamonds 'cause that shit is a facade
Times is really hard I fucked a couple broads
Smoked some purple out the jars let me tell you who we are

I be that pretty mothafucka Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell 'em quit the bitching we gon' make it in a second
Pretty mothafucka Harlem's what I'm repping

Pretty nigga in some shit you never hear of
Only thing bigger than my ego is my mirror
Yeah clothes getting weirder
Money get longer pretty nigga pin your hair up
The nerve of this dude
But I'm cool as a fan forty ounce full of brew

I be that pretty mothafucka Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell 'em quit the bitching we gon' make it in a second
Pretty mothafucka Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell 'em quit the bitching we gon' make it in a second
See me in the hood the gangstas saying wassup 
I swear this famous shit just happened overnight
For sure these hoes was so uptight but now they so polite
All I see is fake love smiles and overbites
But I'm pimping nigga Dolemite
I remember when I was like ten maybe nine
Ricky had a deuce-deuce two shotty pumps with a baby nine
Busta had the rhymes Puffy had the Shyne
Bone Thugs had Mo Thugs but that was the shit that made me rhyme
What's up what's on your mind Hold up I'm feeling fine
Locs got me blind thugging like I'm Eazy-E up in his prime
Another young nigga with a attitude
I guess that's why the crackers kept me after school
Roaches on the wall roaches on the dresser
Everybody had roaches but our roaches ain't respect us
On the park bench playing checkers sipping nectar
Girbaud jeans with hologram straps and reflectors
We had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fistfights
And fish fries and shootouts like one Sig with two rounds
And one click left two down that's four kids but one lived
Left three dead but one split that one miss that one snitched
That's everyday shit we are used to that
Add it up do the math with your stupid ass
Don't view me as no conscious cat this ain't no conscious rap
Fuck the conscious crap my mac'll push your conscience back
I do this for my culture penny nickels in the sofa
Mommy watching Oprah Daddy in the kitchen whipping soda
Cook-connect named Sosa Spanish chick Viola hit it in the chocha
With the Testarossa hit Daytona fuck the law we soldiers
I'm 'bout it 'bout it nigga ain't shit sweet about me
The baddest bitches on the block be even speaking 'bout me
I'm so thuggish ruggish bringing ruckus knucking if you bucking
Young and thugging bugging showing out in public but you love it

I only got one vision that's for kids in every color religion
That listen we gotta beat the system stay the fuck out the prisons
They try to blind our vision but we all God children we siblings
You my brother you my kin fuck the color of your skin

Back once again
Chilling in the back of the 'Lac with a pass or the gin
Finna ask can I pass to her friend
Then a nigga smash I'll be damned if I ask her again
Gold slabs on the 'Lac when I spin
Then it's back to the back of the Benz
Lean back in the back with the Henn and a crap
Max on the ends spend ends I remember way back when
A mothafucka used to have to borrow cash from my friends
Friends just to put a snack up in the fridge
When I'm on I swear to God to pay you back
Now the kids all look up to me
Them bitches wanna fuck with me
My idols say what's up to me
From ugly to comfortably suddenly

It all changed man it was just like yesterday
Times was so ugly and now I'm comfortable
I just only can thank God suddenly
Everything changed before my eyes by my surprise
Get it text a message I don't know the number
Flexin' on these niggas every bone and muscle
Steady taking shots but never hurting numbers
Even then y'all don't worry nothin'
And I'd like to give a shout-out to my niggas with a game plan
And shout-outs to all my niggas with escape plans
Uh twenty bands rain dance
We could either rain check or we can make plans
Pockets loaded rocket loaded okay let's rock and roll
It's time to go Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels
Locked and loaded diamonds glowing chart-climbing on 'em
You'd think I'm jumping out the window how I got 'em open
Line around the corner line 'em up the block and over
Sometimes I even stop the smoking when it's time to focus
My shades Dior my pants velour
Create explore expand conquer

Yeah I sold the pack the loose the hard 
I listened to X I peeped the bars 
The snakes the rats the cats the dogs
The game's a trap protect your heart 
I waited in line return refine
The new design it's time to shine
To shine to shine to shine to shine
I hustle I flex the world is mine
So please believe allow the greaze
These niggas disease don't speak we squeeze
I make the devil go weak at the knees
You hate you're lame your loss

Uh she came I came now what's my name 
My chain my pants my pants with the chain
They know it's me the hat and the shades
They heard my voice and they ran to the stage
My Vans my braids my mans my babes
My girls my ex my hoes that I left
The way I stepped out the car that's a flex
Give thanks get fresh praise the Lord then finesse bless

I came I saw I came I saw
I praise the Lord then break the law
I take what's mine then take some more
It rains it pours it rains it pours

What's this I see Niggas tryna act like G's
Got A$AP got Fergy with me
It's a new day no Black Eyed Peas
 
Mothafucka better blast that shit
Niggas drink quarts of the Clicquot
Bitches sniff raw of the kilos
Flacko makes sales of the perico
'Member I ain't ever have no home
Now I got a penthouse and a beach home
Back when I was rockin' least 
I was trappin' off at least like three phones
Me and Yams made the plan
Then I paid myself and I gave myself advance
Way before I became myself
I'd like to thank myself because I made myself the man
It's like lately I ain't myself
I'd rather hang myself before I play myself
Know the one that fit the booty all skin tight that's right
Frontin' like you did it for the fellas
Get all the bitches jealous when you do that shit
But my neck is gold the rest is froze
Sex and hoes best of both girls and girls perpetual
Sippin' slow Texas throwed comma I'm about decimals
Chill and get faded I'm surprised that we made it
Young niggas know the sky's the limit
All I ever wanna do is chill and get shaded
Chill and get faded shit I'm surprised that we made it
Nowadays stress overrated
All I ever wanna do is chill and get shaded

I wanna see you take it all off
And she just wanna make it harder
And we just end up takin' longer
Can't impress with them diamonds though them diamonds

Money talk and dogs bark
I got a pocket full of stones in my stonewashed
Lambo brand new Lambo
With tiger stripes on it call that bitch a golf cart
I'm outchea I'm so outchea I swear niggas have no idea
I swear niggas better wear riot gear
'Cause I appear and pow loud and clear give 'em diarrhea oh
I re-up tonight I'mma be up tonight cookin' a key up tonight
Niggas de-up I slide to the right throw a three up in time
Put a B up let's fight don't get beat up tonight
Feet up in my European I ride with me heater inside
Like you sneeze you on tight you got beef I got white
You got beef I got white I got green I got white
I got pink I got pints I got lean I got ice
I got needles and pipes I got clean I got right
I got mean I got nice That's that Tina and Ike
I don't lean on her price I don't cheat on her price
Try to cheat on the dice you get beat on the spot
I get keys on the spot and I keep it on lock
And I keep it up safe what you keep in your safe 
S'what I spent on my watch and I wave it like Ma$e
Bout to redo the face get a see-through AK
I eat seafood and steak
But girl I'mma treat you like cake til I get a sweet tooth ache
But wait let's talk about M's not about them
Let's pluck out the stems let's fuck like a nymph
She walk out she limp it's dark and we dim yeah
We them niggas handcuffing him niggas back up and skim niggas
See that we strapped up we cap up your brim nigga
Fill my cup up to the rim nigga Tunechi
When I'm a man of my word then I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up but where do I land if I fall 
But never mind I'm fly you know

She the type to seek love and make it everlasting
I'm the type to wake up and say you never happened
I mean I fucked the girl with hella passion
But it's cold how we smashing left her sleeping on a separate mattress
I think her body makes for better practice
Flacko where your ass been
Heard you done with fashion now yo ass is acting
I'm tripping off the acid now yo ass is looking massive
This ain't the shit equipped with columns from my reckless swagging
This that dark house party with this record blasting
Rolling spliffs clique beside me fingers Liberace
When I seen this bitch in vintage Tommy and some mid Huaraches
I'm all alone though mood music makes me bop slower
Trippin' on how I shifted pop culture changed hip-hop on ya
Smoking like a rasta was my pop's culture
I be damned if I die sober I'll be sure to visit Pac for ya

When I'm a man of my word then I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up but where do I land if I fall 
But never mind I'm fly you know

And shout outs my pretty womens in the spot tonight
Let em see them fuckin' hands
And for the freaks that love the niggas with the Jeeps
Lex coupes and the Beamers and the Benz come again
When my death calls I pray the Lord accept collect calls
'Cause I be playing with these womens like they sex dolls
Call my Prada prior 'cause it's dropping next fall
Don't you short the next ball my closet like the Met ball
She said I just love it when you speak soft-spoken
Up in the magazines with your teeth all golden
Took the whole year off just to learn to make beats
Dropped the flames on my release and leave the streets all smokin'
That touch your soul music I get you higher
Grab your lighter fluid might add a preacher and a choir to it
I speak the father's music hallelujah
Even Montell can't tell you how we do it
Sit back and watch me do it

When I'm a man of my word then I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up but where do I land if I fall 
But never mind I'm fly you know

Okay let's get past all the swag trapping and fashion talking
You want that take it to gats or keep it in rapping talking
They rapping bars it get embarrassed it actually happens often
You my son like my last abortion I'm just laughing off it
I changed rap I'm fashion forward yeah I'm that important
You jack my style she jack me off and y'all both acting awkward 
Jiggling baby nah go ahead bitch
Ain't nothing better than the pretty big forehead bitch
Listen close I got some shit to tell you motherfuckers get familliar
It's not just model bitches on my genitalia
Cinderella's under my umbrella for different weather
Niggas taking pictures any time we get together
And hope to fly away one day just like some love birds
Only one word I'm afraid of is the love word

What's up bruh That all depends
With friends like you who need friends
Sometimes the best advice is no advice
Especially when it's your advice
Oh Man remember
Your man was on stage dressed like a family member
Man everything basic to Ye Guevara
That means Saint Laurent is my Zara
I remember Rochelle ain't wanna fuck me with the polo
Ay bitch you missed out #fomo
I got one child one child
They wanna throw me under a white jail
'Cause I'm a black man with confidence of a white male
Hallelujah
Goddamn how real is this 
I know them Harlem niggas gon' be feeling this
East Coast nigga but how trill is this 
Still don't give a shit my ignorance is still a bliss

For really real we chilly chill don't sport Chinchilla
No bounty hunters I'm bout to killa I'm bout my skrilla
Give me the title then give me the cash
Fold it then bag it then move to the trap
Follow my stash stealing my swag
Niggas is wickity wack
Like Kriss Kross her lip gloss
Slip-ons get slipped off
My bitch boss Cristal
We smoking then thinking then burning that hash
Puff it and pass making it last
Walk in my shoes and then cross in my path
Game was for grabs making 'em crash

Fuck the money fuck the fame this is real life
An insight to my trill life

Gots to come leaning drinking codeine and every fuckin day straight promethazine and

She sip it 'til it's empty
Purple on the mustache now it's time to screw you
And I wanna chop and screw you girl
Moving like it's turtle time feeling like the world is my mine

Gots to come faded drinking codeine and every fuckin day straight promethazine and
Faded drinking codeine and every fuckin day straight promethazine and
Gots to come leaning drinking codeine and every fuckin day straight promethazine and

This is music for the villains sophisticated children
A$AP in the house now we're finna run the building
Working never chilling 'til I get a million
To the ceiling now my niggas gunning for a billion
They ask me how I'm living I say I'm gold grilling
Niggas acting different mothafuck a friendship
These bitches is persistent talking 'bout I'm distant
Lost my mind a long time ago to find it need forensics
For instance I get-get my dick licked
Red bone complexion like a piglet kiss-kiss
Fuck Ace we sip Cris a 40 'cause I'm getting it
Drip-drip the thought of it is ignorant isn't it  
I'm ticklish stunting is my business
Swagging on you hoes and I'm shitting on you niglets
So little homie peep game
'Cause these other rappers lame and don't care to do the same

Well let me tell you 'bout a nigga like me

She wanna take a dick ride we slide
Straight to the telly shaking her jelly with my dick inside
Hit it in motion in slow motion hit it
Nigga she's open nigga I'm poking split it
With it get it right there in the bed
Open up your legs let me beat that pussy red
Fuck what you said I'mma still do me
Groupies be sucking and fucking porno movie
Do we have a problem in here
Look a nigga in the eye as I notice the fear
I am severe my style is hella sharp like a spear
All I do is sit back and think with a forty beer
And you gotta feel the funk
While the bass plays loud booming all in your damn trunk
 
I get so high I touch the sky 'til I can't even function
I get so high I fuck around and wanna leave the function
The only thing that's on my mind is I'm gon' leave with something
But it's nothing and we roll one with the 'tussin and we gon' get

It's about to go down drunker than a bitch
Afterparty with my niggas slumber party with your bitch
Let it get the mix everyday we gettin' gettin' lit
That Purrp purp and I get lit 'methazine tell 'em sip this
A 50 box of them Swishers gold slabs on them 6's
In the back seat full of bitches tryna hit licks we gon' get lit

No diamonds on it

Young nigga from the southside of H-Town

Niggas so throwed like we don't know no better nigga
We disobedient nigga

Coming down coming live
We use to wear rugged boots now it's all tailored suits
Audemars Piguets for my criminal recruits
Champagne flutes bumpin' rhythm and the blues
My partner made bad moves he might end up in the news
Or end up in the tombs or living in the boondocks
Riding by the rules I'll abide by it soon
See the situation we sophisticated goons
I know you live by the gun then you die by it too
Niggas call me prophecy swagging and philosophies
White on white wagon call that motherfucker Socrates
Rat ass niggas fighting for a block of cheese
Catch me out in China stunting yea I'm about my guapanese
My shoe game serious so serious Wapanese
Niggas say I'm blessed my bad I forgot to sneeze 
There your reasons go bitch
I got some tissues for your issues tell 'em blow this

It's the gold teeth French braids call me Project Pat
With the stocking cap Jason mask on probably strapped
It's the Rocky cat turn my swag on holla back
Throw a dollar at her suck my dick
'Cause they hatin on my clid-dick
'Cause we made it when we did it hate it 'cause they didn't
My mama always told me keep your mind on your money
Boy you better pay attention
Ride with the pretty nigga hoopty no chauffeur
Paint lookin like a drippin smoothy no coaster
The game's full of posers big dog bulldozer
Pop up on 'em like toasters wake 'em up like Folgers
'Cause Heaven need a villain like Hell need a newer idol
You could bet the crib and car just renew the title
For now I'm pimpin' like them Do or Die dudes
Smoking killa but my doors still suicidal

It will hit you on the head
You don't even gotta hate me now babe
Just as sheeps get led ohh
You could see where I'm going ohh
How you gonna feel now You know what they say
Really you know that we don't come how we get down
Everyone say that Rocky ahead
They rollin do what he said no they can't get it wrong

Make my money walk straight ahead now
They countin' every day down waitin' on me long
You know your way Where you headin' now 
Me I want everything  it won't take me long
Make my money walk straight ahead now
They countin' every day down waitin' on me long
You know your way Where you headin' now 
Me I want everything  it won't take me long
Smoking rolling reefer up I adjust the tweakers up
Break it break it down break it down so I can beat it up
Where the welcome back Where the welcome mat My sneaker tough
This is for my old head go on turn your speakers up
Rocky where you been I been tryna make my ends meet
So I can cop that Bathing Ape or Jeremy Scott or ten Deep
Bottles full of Rose riding in the Benz jeep
Blowing money fast now I'm finna think I'm Big Meech
I met with my old head we sat for a while
We rolled a couple swishers we chat for a while
I said I'm just on my grind I come to Houston all the time
He said what's been goin' down in your New York state of mind
Fine you ever got days you feel like giving up
Like how you gon' eat when this gig is up
When the chips is down and the jig is up
But I don't give a fuck roll another swisher up
'Cause I just came here down South so I could get these pounds out
And move my mother nice somewhere closer than a town house
And my beats banging kicking harder than a roundhouse
I spoke with my old head and this is what I found out

Life is just a bitch a bitch is like a ho
Hoes want the money but money come and goes
Friends turn to foes 
If you listen when ya old head talkin' you'll be straight

Now my old head old age bald head rogaine
Code red codeine nose red cocaine
Pimpin bitches since lemon chicken shrimp lo mein
Gold chains afros platforms soul train
And he told me 'bout that rapping trapping in the old days
And I'm so high I could fuck around and grow wings
And we sipping on something purpler than Soul Plane
We sip slow  swing tip foes and chrome wings
Told me I should head home and do my own thang
Then I heard my phone rang hold up that's my old dame
Pick it up I hit you back miss me and I miss you back
She said Harlem miss you too and they can't wait to get you back
You should come on home leave the drugs alone and stick to rap
Just don't come back flossin 'cause that type of shit'll get you clapped

Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye stepped up in this piece
Bust my Glock to ensure that all you niggas rest in peace
Uh Schwarzenegger I straight slaughter niggas
I'm offin' niggas screaming off with niggas' heads
They all surrender better call for niggas
Come at all you niggas heads talk 'em off a ledge
I'm arguing with 'em I'm done talking with 'em
I order coffins for 'em call the coroner for 'em
Get a comforter for 'em I did all you niggas' beds
I want all you niggas dead
You want oil nigga money royalness and bread
Royalties instead of rollies for your boys but loyalty is dead

Now I'm only up again
Kick a man while he's down
Looks dead can't be safe to say it
Everybody's getting punished
Looking down to sell with you how have you been 
Probably an undercover had them undercovers with you
People buying and selling for you
I'll only sell with you if you're blind to sell

Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye stepped up in this piece
Bust my Glock to ensure that all you niggas rest in peace
Rep my block quick to draw on all you niggas if there's beef
Blow your spot better pray to Lord this shit don't hit the streets

Tired of these rappers tired of these jackers
Tired of these dances by these fucking backpackers
And I'm sick of all these hipsters I'm sick of phony niggas
I'm sticking to these bitches 'cause I'm sick of all these sisters
I'm sick and tired of tryna survive I'm sick tired of my environment
I'm sick and tired of feeling deprived I'm one of a kind when in my climate
I'm sick and tired of your facade and all of your lying and all your diamonds
Basically I'm tired of feeling sick and tired
A$AP born in money makin' Manhattan
Every nigga on my block wanna be a Main Attrakion
Shout my nigga Squadda shout my nigga Mondre
If you disrespect them niggas then I'm polishin' the nine
And I'm coming to your casa for your madre and padre
Comprende Most of these niggas been gay or they strange
They say I sound like Andre mixed with Kanye little bit of Max
Little bit of Wiz little bit of that little bit of this get off my dick

I'm in your hood you ain't got no ticket
I'mma down to Earth nigga we could kick it
Take a hit with me take a hit with me
Ain't on stage behind the scene I'm probably mixing lean
Chilling with my niggas with my team
Come and take a sip with me take a sip with me

Once again Mister Back Selling Crack
It's an honor keeping real nigga music on the map
Street raps new face sampled with no credits
Doubting myself 'cause I don't think the world can relate
To my surprise everyone does so have faith
Half of the other side don't live it they push play
The young illest alive Harlem world to the Bay
It feels good waking up to money in the bank
'Cause last year it was shoe box and lint
I only write raps just to give you niggas hints
Every verse a gift as you smoke like a chimney
My album coming November that's twenty years of memory
And that's assuming I'mma live that long
If I don't don't cry 'cause I ain't live that wrong
Just an artist in a purest form I live that song
An artist in the purest form I live that song Bambino

I'm in your hood you ain't got no ticket
I'mma down to Earth nigga we could kick it
Take a hit with me take a hit with me
Ain't on stage behind the scene I'm probably mixing lean
Chilling with my niggas with my team
Come and take a sip with me take a sip with me

Why fuss I'd rather fuck
Treat her like my enemy I just wanna bust
7 deuce waiting on the bus
Before the boys bend the corner tryna make a bust
Tryouts I'm tryna make the bucks
Purple and the green got me on stuck
So I two-step move my foot and keep it pushing
Always bouncing back got it keep the cushion
And that's something fat like eating all the pudding
A$AP we got it slap bruh good looking
Fuck That ASAP where I come from
Weed in my pocket coke in his tongues
Buying swisher sweets no more honey buns
Fresh white tee bright like the sun
Only nigga round here rocking

I'm in your hood you ain't got no ticket
I'mma down to Earth nigga we could kick it
Take a hit with me take a hit with me
Ain't on stage behind the scene I'm probably mixing lean
Chilling with my niggas with my team
Come and take a sip with me take a sip with me

This go out to all the rappers this go out to the little darlings
The little kids running around in the schoolyards I love you
Keep it good keep it good kids 'cause you know I love you
I'mma always love you forever

Back in this bitch mothafucka yeah it's me
SpaceGhostPurrp and I put your bitch to sleep
Me and my twin at it again with this phonk
Sipping on gin living in sin lean in the trunk
My fucking brain is purple nigga

It be that pretty mothafucka sipping that throwed
Gripping my pistol my chrome
Hidden to hit you then splitting your wig into something
I spit it and flip it like Bone
Niggas ain't ready for the flow switch
Only Harlem nigga on his Bone shit
Won't you see a nigga getting throwed bitch
Two middle fingers to the show bitch
'Cause they selfish in the show biz
'Cause they shelf kids and it's hopeless
Career dying quicker than a goldfish
I be the fly young fella Maison Martin Margiela
Bitches Cinderellas under my umbrella I go and tell her

All hell here bitch it's Satan talking
Told her to take it off give her the D she take the offense
Skinny nigga balling trip but never falling
Who said to make it rain Bitch I make it pouring
I'm a cake-o-saurus go study my nature
Big chain on me like Treach from Naughty by Nature
Fuck what you saying no way a hater don't faze a gangster
Brought up in danger all about paper smoking on purple
Bitch I'm Dangerous Nasty Crazy nineties Baby momma I made it
Up to the sky goodbye to the pavement hoes get caught in amazement
I'm stuck in my ways so fuck 'em up I fuck 'em and duck 'em for days
What more can I say I'm chasing this paper that's purple nigga
Get money addict I'mma get Money tattooed
Money in the attics money in the stashes
Money in the cabinets stuffed in the mattress
Safe full of guns more money up in that shit
Maison Martin Margiela three strap sneakers
Riding with a leacher student and a teacher
It's money over bitches no room for a skeezer
Thinking of a Lambo Bathing Ape camo
Play with the money turn Rocky into Rambo
Patience is a virtue life is a handful
Friends they'll hurt you learned that from my grandfolks
Me under a lamp post while I got my hands closed
Haze to my brains like eggs got it scrambled
Yeah I feel Rihanna and I understand Hov
What you think I rap for To push a fucking Land Rove 
Now I'm looking back when you said I shouldn't rap
Some slept on me other niggas took a nap
Now I'm in the basement probably cooking crack
Gave you teaspoons full but instead you took a cap
They say Tyga and Diggy but Rocky been Jiggy
Curren$y from the Wiz ain't enough to get me home
Can't really hate when they compare me to Drake

But I'm fly like I never left
You's a lie like fly without the letter F
If hip hop is dead fuck it let it rest
Reincarnated through me when she resurrect
High top boots like Pac in a Juice scene
No it ain't a movie diamonds in by new gleam
Dead tone 'cause the redbones is my new thing

Nigga I do things let the coupe sing
Niggas say I'm insane Saddam Hussein
Niggas still jokers me I'm on my Bruce Wayne
Fly kicks my shit yeah I'm on that Liu Kang
I ain't bragging but I do this my shoes is Bermudas
I'm bougie in that Gucci but my nudies is my newest
And your foolishness and rumors I give two shits
I only hear the money save the bullshit
Swag is the coolest my bitch is the rudest
My jeweler is Jewish and my wrist is the bluest
And I get it poppin on the block like Whoo Kid
ASAP standing on the block like the new kids
Love on the low love everywhere I go
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belong

My ears are ringing my palms are shaking my heart is racing
Somebody's mama's heart is aching can't take it partly fainted
Found his body parts in awkward places
Like apartments basements
Garbage vacant lots garages spaces
Harlem's far too spacious
Sometimes I wish I could get away and charter spaceships
To get away from my inhuman race with hearts of Satans
Kick off my Maison Martin's lay on back like Martha Mason
Smoke away my iron lung 'til later die at seventy-one

There's someone's journey in the streets
Who gotta keep a piece peace
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray to God I rest in peace
I pray to Lord my soul to keep

Gentrification split the nation that I once was raised in
I don't recall no friendly neighbors face on my upraising
Back in my younger days or razor blades with gangs
Who bang and never stood a chance
Them boys don't dance but left 'em Harlem shaking
On the pavement and my generation fucked and my society
Very trippy pages in my diary
It's the irony how LSD inspired me to reach the higher me
Used to never give a damn now I don't give a fuck entirely
I think my pride died in me somewhere inside of me
It's gotta be awhole 'nother side of me
If you seen the shit that I'd have seen in twenty-six years of living
That's how many fucks I'd give 

Love on the low love everywhere I go
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belong

I lay down now
There's someone's journey in the streets
Who gotta keep a piece peace
I lay down now
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray to God I rest in peace

Love on the low love everywhere I go
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belong
I thought you said you'd never leave
I think back as I took a puff
Know what happens every time you leave
Always come back 'cause you wanna fuck
Always come back 'cause you wanna fuss
Holdin' back ain't no turnin' back when you fall in love
Know what happens every time you speed
Always fall flat 'cause you wanna rush
So we could take it slow
Separate the highs from the lows
Separate the evens from the odds
I just hope you put me back together when I come apart

I come apart and you keep it together
I come apart and I can't stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me I cannot compare
I come apart this can't last forever
Can't last forever

I woke up today high
Felt a little less pressure from you
And I'm here to say I
Maybe even learned a lesson from you
If you find a way to fight the pain which we endure
If you fly away then rest assured

I come apart and you keep it together
I come apart and I can't stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me I cannot compare
I come apart this can't last forever
Can't last forever

You're the eye but I'm tearing all the time
Always there to catch me but I'm never coming down
Reconstructing all the pieces I left in my way
I guess you know in control
Chaos I create
I come apart

You made a bet with me now you're in debt with me
Made my bed lied in it then you slept with me
It's ruthless she the closest thing next to me
The truth is that she blew it and you left with me
Especially hard to express to me
European attitude but born in West Philly
She just have a smokin' 'gina where the Wet Willies
I come apart I'm in her heart on her left titty

I come apart and you keep it together
I come apart and I can't stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me I cannot compare
I come apart this can't last forever
Can't last forever
They tryna front on the gang 
Ayy anybody ever took the time to ask Rocky what A$AP mean to him 
Well if so he'll probably tell you Always Striving and Prospering

She losin' her mind we kiss to Frank Ocean and Blonde
Convincin' my bitch to go blonde
I Was born in the dark I kill you to open my blinds
On Yams and that's word to my moms
Margiela Madman with cases I'm still tryna beat
A bunch of shit from a long time ago
The bigger they are the harder they fall
Like dominos nigga Geronimos
When it's my time to go adios vamonos
Flacko no Dominicano but eat the tostones with platanos
Dealing with life and its highs and lows
I'm just pimpin' like I'm supposed
I guess it's called livin' shit I suppose
Ain't talkin' 'bout spending or buyin' clothes
I'm 'bout my business but I'm alone
I still had the vision when I was broke
Fuckin' on bitches and foreign hoes
Flyin' out womens to boring shows
I pray to God I don't overdose

I put A$AP on my tat 
I put New York on the map 
I put the gang on the flames 
They gon' remember the name
They robbin' boys for the chains 
I got Goyard by the sack 
I got the boof by the pack 
I fucked your boo on her back

Them boys not flexing the same
I'm done with adjusting to fame pull up on your set leave a stain
I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell 'em don't fuck with the gang it's time to fuck up the whole game 

I'm free as a bird I wanted this shit my whole life
But had all this stress on my mind
Until I realized things pan out when it's right
In the meantime I'ma grind
I think of them days when I was so young on my plight
Party and bullshit and play
Was up in the city the one that's surrounded by lights
Wanted to burn it away
Get out of his lane got no time don't need no advice
Except for my momma
Ride for my daughter she's all I need
She got her father as I grow
Hell yeah I did it I'm on a roll
Thought I'd be up with my nigga no
I'm just gettin' warmed up let's start the show
I'm schoolin' these niggas so in the zone and I'm rigged to blow
A$AP and Cud Life forever though
And I'm flossin' and bossin' these silly hoes
Learned the codes serve up the magic for all of those
Kids that ain't had someone on they own
Hang on the words you each have your song
Grab on and hold on won't steer you wrong
Sing along sing along hmm

Them boys not flexing the same
I'm done with adjusting to fame pull up on your set leave a stain
I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell 'em don't fuck with the gang it's time to fuck up the whole game

They tryna front on the gang they gon' remember my name
True to truth somehow 
But never truly lied at all then and now
They tryna front on the gang
Gang A$AP boys come with the flame
But never truly lied at all then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all then and now

I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant to lie
I've been fuckin' busy I've been busy fuckin'
I've been all kinds of busy or sorta kinda busy
Like shorty is we fuckin' Well if not then fuck it
Apologies to the fam we thought we ducked 'em
Said I was in a rush but I was busy rushin'
It's busy shit busy that busy this
And I need a minute 

See this what that voice in your head says
When you try to get peace of mind

Spendin' time spinnin' out toward a desire that wasn't pure
Born before the virus was cured pitch perfect violins on the floor
Fast forward linings on my skull
This the type of design I could afford
Fast forward bands out
Got they hands out like they acknowledgin' the Fuhrer
Rewind Nas track 6 rewind dance crazes
Read my mind freed my mind feed my mind makes sense
Just like mirrors on the wall just like sittin' on me
Raw in mirrors seen it all could make two a piece of mind
Flickin' ash pourin' a half don't pour in a glass
Pour it in foam that's white like eggshells in my omelette
My earlobes they yellow like the yolk is runnin'
Brain on drugs I still ain't got no peace of mind fuck
Roof lost on the Wraith roof lost on the way
Freeway no Rozay brute force Brut champagne
Tell the front desk to cut new keys
Reserved in the Mercer for two years in two suites
Took out the bed like it's fuck sleep
I'll smack a bitch like it's hot hands
Fired the label like fuck brands
Comfortable low nigga fuck Xans
Comfortable slow who the fuck ran
Nothin' is sweet nothin' in tank sweet it's just a tank P
Salt on a slug soda on slugged teeth chewing on nothing
You're tweakin' or somethin' you're reachin' for somethin'
You're speakin' speak up then you're thinkin' you're overthinkin'
One blink and I'm precummin'
That could turn every no one into someone

I just need peace of mind for my purity
You make my heart desire pure just tell me

Memories burn the roaches
Cheer Hennessy for my old heads
Amphetamines for the dosage
Keepin' me up and focused
Jewelry cloth my gold caps
New-York throwback like the old Fab
Lost in the Google Maps in your iMac think my phone tapped
Hold up hold that  thought
Nigga pour up soda nigga hold that cough tryna hold back
The call had dropped when the FaceTime paused don't call back
Can't cope when your heart broke
Soft-spoken roll somethin' cop somethin' Narco
Saint life Joan of Arc bro ring barcode
Two of everything should have been to blame when Noah's Ark broke
Two more drinks of everything before the bar closed
Face-to-face with my demons at a barstool
Haven't checked on my niece in weeks
Months past and months in between since me and my sister would speak
Not a call or visit in weeks lost nothin' since the September last
Seen her September man it feels like
Lose someone every release it feels like the curse is in me
Press is gone and I grief I share with you my peace

So big you are shining like the star
With your head in the clouds 'til somebody shoot you down
Hands on the ground back against the wall
Tell me who you call when no one else around

The future will be televised haters getting genocide
My niggas is hella fly you over accessorize
Dead alive it's in my repertoire forever ever high
I never lie never tell a lie I would testify
Set aside dreams I'm a king ask Coretta Scott
Cute faced fat ass and a nice set of thighs

Everybody knows me shit still ain't got no cash
Bitch hit that flash quick post my bad habits
Fuck you and your Instagram match a gram Mando
Royal blue foams getting head in the red Lambo
Bitch I'm hard and my loop concrete too much Bossip if you ask me
Almost fucked fame but she came with money
I got two bad bitches haters wanna take em from me

Tryin' to get on in this industry acting like you're ruthy
However whatever they seeing on the box
Everybody spit everybody hot everybody's an artist everybody not
In a minute I'mma lose my cool Sprewell
Like fuck coach I'm cutthroat so what goes
Do you head for the year they say might be the end 
Better look within

Glitz and the glamors we pose for the cameras
Ghetto niggas with me they pose with the hammers
Ghetto girls with me pink toes in the sandals
No dirty laundry get your nose out my hamper
Clothes in my hamper that bathing ape camouflage
Brands from Japan you would think I was a samurai
Drop-crotch Jeremy Scott pants bitch it's Hammer Time
Getting dirty money but I keep my hand sanitized
Life is what you need won't you take a Z feel the breeze
Smoke the sour diese' hit that shit and please act at ease
What you wanna be like the Black Eyed Peas all these steezs
Stars that's Hollywood won't you rest in peace

So big you are shining like the star
With your head in the clouds 'til somebody shoot you down
Hands on the ground back against the wall
Tell me who you call when no one else around
Everyday was like a beef to me
Little nigga said he'd make it hot
You don't wanna draw heat with me
I got niggas that'll run up in your spot
Cooly nigga you don't really want beef
I'm Biggaveli I could do this in my sleep
My bitch now tryna comfort me
And baby I wonder baby I wonder

Uh buccaneers of rugged gear nigga fuck a fair
One since year one I've been thuggin' here yeah uh
Whole shit is ours you in awe please don't get involved
This is war walk around a frame with blaze up in this jawn
Behind prison walls niggas lickin' balls pause
Different 'cause stricted laws
Damn if I don't break up in the mall prison yard prison guard
No principal detention on your friends and all
Commissary missing like your sibling's paw
Uncle Tom please don't make my sentence long
Granted what I did was wrong
Pigs don't show remorse if you admit it all
Missing ma hope that she don't miss the call
Admitted that she'll never visit
Like the hard headed never listen Lord
So tell me how the fuck I'm supposed to eat  
If the richer's getting richer the poor's growing weak 
My brother died up in the streets may he rest in peace
Niggas got heat like Pusha T get it cheap
Flacko how you been where you at I've been kickin' back
Relax place down my favorite thinking cap scratch my nigga neck
Hitta chit and chat this and that A$AP diplomats
I'm missing Max wish that they could bring the nigga Bigga back

And I wonder laying in my bed
Am I still too young Am I still too young 
And I hold back thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up Did I fuck it up 

It's like I lace up my boots and call my troops lately
Traded all my hoodie rap for all my suits lately
I'm twenty-six but I've been living in my youth lately
Pull my wisdom but I still spit it like my tooth ache me
Duck shots motherfuck cops what's up blood clots 
All I gots my words and my balls and my one cock
Pause buckshots fly my young buck died
Passed away from a stray from some fake tough guy
Now this the kind of story that should make doves cry
Fuck that this the story that should make thugs cry
Dry your eyes older sis held 'em close watch 'em twitch
Gave 'em kiss in the midst of all of this
Ain't too late to pause or skip

And I wonder laying in my bed
Am I still too young Am I still too young 
And I hold back thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up Did I fuck it up 

I'm Biggaveli I could do this in my sleep
Baby I wonder baby I wonder

And I wonder as I'm laying in my bed
Am I still too young Am I still too young 
And I hold back thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up Did I fuck it up 
And I wonder as I'm laying down in bed
Am I still too young Am I still too young 
And I hold back thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up Did I fuck it up 

Sorry guys
People think you're stuck up but we're all super good friends
It's only natural I suppose but we're all super good friends
Um I get the feeling that you're admired but um
I'm above average

Got the Mac and the ski mask in case you come for me

When they say they got beef they don't wanna eat

Fix the face then fix the weave now workin' on her self-esteem

Phoney folks play it close do the most don't they 

Bad company that's bad for your company
Mad cow disease now you in a ton of beef
Black Mac tucked underneath my new blue dungarees

Fruity pebble bezel Wilma Betty Fred and Barney

Gettin' money is 
I thought you knew
Gettin' money is 
I thought y'all knew
Gettin' money is 
It's what I do
Gettin' money is 

I remember all the nights
On different corners spittin' pitchin' water
Now I'm richer off the shit I thought of
From the home of the richest ballers
I'm Richard Porter mixed with Mr. Porter
This picture all the jiggy shit I ordered
I went to France and almost got deported
The fans is screaming when I hit the border
I visit Nice like it's my sister's daughter
Vision broad I thought of all the different kids and all
Poor without a sip of water time to get my shit in order
And do somethin' different gettin' tired of the same old shit
When I'm spittin' lines 'bout the section lines
I sit you kids who listen for us
I see prison for us until we pull back that's a true fact
Get money yeah I do that thought you knew that

Gettin' money is 
I thought you knew

I thought y'all knew
Gettin' money is

Gettin' money is 

Candy low slider I'm a soul survivor
Keep a Sweet in my visor bitch I'm keepin' it liver

A helluva blow from a millionaire snow
You can waste your time chillin
Now I'm puttin' em on the spot I give a ho the blues

Bitch I came from having nothin' damn right I have to brag
Try me and I'll pop your ass stupid nigga get a body bag
All I talk is money ho rich niggas don't lollygag

Gettin' money is the main reason most people wake up
The root of why most relationships is startin' break ups
While niggas get haircuts and bitches do makeup
While we take their penitentiary chances we shake up
It's an everyday struggle for the almighty dollar
Some is in the streets and some is workin' blue collar
Real up in your field and man it make you wanna holler
Say your prayer for a player amen inshallah
Been like that ain't a damn thing change
Money on mind the red of my brain
Candy paint is gonna drip that stain
Lean on left the grip of my grain
See ain't a damn thing change but the weather
So If you ain't breakin' bread then we can't even sit together

New bags on new bags
Mind's better at seeing two now
Needing up on my downtime
Hit the waves with the new sound
House tunes but its screwed down
Take a sec to thank the Lord 'nother one to call my folks
Hit my momma on the phone she says Son you the boss
Focus don't get caught up in the moment
Can't forget that I'm golden don't forget that I'm chosen

Fuck home fuck sleep come clean zonin'
Can't forget that I'm golden can't forget where I'm going
Fuck popo police enemies fake homies
Can't forget that I'm a OG better act like you know it

He told me when I'm present I'm chosen
So hold me tight I swear I'm golden

Fuck home fuck sleep come clean zonin' 
Can't forget that I'm golden can't forget where I'm going
Fuck popo police enemies fake homies 
Can't forget that I'm a OG better act like you know it

Pissed me off then tried to hold it against me
Or wish we off the worst of luck that ever hated
Never hesitated the designated all of the wrong that they did me
Is stored in my memory all of the thoughts that I thought of

Peep my repertoire Uptown espionage

Stoned-stoned when I'm in my zoney-zone
Smokin' on the homegrown feeling like I'm all alone

And now somebody else is eating all the pudding
Things change now my dashboard wooden
All black Benz like a young Doc Gooden
Dark shades 'cause I'm stone crazy
Girl we grown stop playing on my phone baby
All your childish attempts to make me angry fall short
Which only fuels the rage you have because you have nothing
Understandable I'm shining brilliant with five Brazilians
There were times I used to hide my feelings
Now I'm butt naked in the Lamborghini
And motherfuckers can't see me
Wait 'til this chick see me on TV I make the shit look easy
Who would've thought I hit you right back 

So many women wanna call me baby
And you wonder why the fuck that I ain't call you lately
Some would say that I'm the symbol for sex and uh
Others would hate but I don't give 'em no breath
Go on a date I'm at the crib with the chef and uh that's me
And you could order whatever
The specialty is white snake and underwear sauce
You could probably catch me somewhere where the sun is next
And I understand that's only 'cause I'm popular
I'm getting topped off in the front row of the opera
As Bocelli sings the celly rings
I gotta go you'll never know how good it feels to lay in bed with king
I'm not exactly flawless but I'm gorgeous just like a horse is
I know the thought of me succeeding makes a lot of people nauseous
Still I'm on the back of the boat taking pictures with the swordfish

Why you always all on my back 
Why you gotta do me like that 
Why you gotta act like a bitch when I'm with you 
Baby girl I'm blue

I hope you get a paper cut on your tongue
From a razor in a paper cup
I hope every soda you drink already shaken up
I hope your dreams dry like raisins in the baking sun
I hope your titties all saggy in your early twenties
I hope there's always snow in your driveway
I hope you never get off Fridays
And you work at a Friday's that's always busy on Fridays
I hope you win the lottery and lose your ticket
I hope it's Ben and Socrates poop all up in your kitchen
I hope the zipper on your jacket get stuck
And your headphones short and your charger don't work
And you spill shit on your shirt
I hope your tears don't hurt and I can smile in your face
Cut my losses how Delilah changed my locks to a fade
I hope you happy I hope you happy
I hope you ruined this shit for a reason I hope you happy 

Uh yeah uh opportunity be knockin' let a motherfucker in

Ma you know I'm still your little baby

All my life I was a fuck-up now I pull the truck up
Same bitch stuck up now she wanna suck us

No more tough luck a different cloth is what I'm cut from
Baby oh my lord
The cops chasin' Bronson in an all-white Ford
Shit I'm on that all-night tour
Bitch I'm alright but I'm off that raw
I'm in a robe dancin' salsa on the top floor
You would swear I'm Puerto Rican but I'm not lord
Hot hoes every city that we go singin'
All I do is eat oysters
And speak six languages in three voices
It's Adriatic Summers on a sail boat
Don't even try to call I'm not available for nothin'
Unless it's stupid paper hop out the Studebaker
With Anita Baker uh

Opportunity be knockin' you gotta let a motherfucker in
I kiss my mother on the cheek tell her that I love her
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing I got it covered
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy 
Ma you know I'm still your little baby

Uh I feel so alive I think I shit myself

I'm starin' at the man inside the mirror
The reflection shows a wolf though 
Goddamn I'm still cute ho 
All my women play the flute
Saw me plate some melon and prosciutt'
Left handed make the Fender cry
Count money with a reverend's smile the Devil's eye
Half-Cherokee and Gemini uh
Motherfuckers'll dump heat from Jump Street
And turn your chest plate to lunch meat
I'm in a Humvee lookin' like a young me
Now these motherfuckers all wanna be chubby
I switch the season now the hair's curled
Tan skin I need a bad girl
'Cause James Brown said It's A Man's World
In a Transam' Twirl the burner handle made of pearl
That's just Daddy's Little Girl

Opportunity be knockin' you gotta let a motherfucker in
I kiss my mother on the cheek tell her that I love her
You ain't gotta worry 'bout a thing I got it covered
Why you think I'm out here actin' crazy 
Ma you know I'm still your little baby
Praise the lord I was born to drive boat
Feeling like Slash in front of the chapel
I'm leaned back with the Les Paul
Shit I smoke is like cholesterol
Spilled dressin' on the vest at the festival
The best of all had a midget Puerto Rican at my beck and call
Best believe that there was neck involved
Fucked around and almost wrecked the Saab
Uh we took acid for ten days straight up in the mountains
Started running with the stallions
Playing frisbee in the West Indies did the tango with my kidneys
Eyes open now I know just who my kids need
Rockin' very loose pants yeah
Buried a million in the sand by the clock tower
Before I die take a hot shower

Ride the Harley into the sunset

By chance I seen her in the lobby of the Ritz
With her man the one that swings a hockey stick
I was wearing all white and my hair was looking precious
Shit I might cop a chest and a dresser
A little machine to make espresso
I heard your bitch still wears Ecko
Hide drugs behind the box of De Cecco
Live from the Expo it's me
I wear the wolf in the winter steer the coupe from the center
Who gives a fuck I'm a sinner
I had dreams of fuckin' Keri Hilson in my Duncans
Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin
Bite the eel by the dozen 
Bite the eel by the dozen

Pump the bass in the trunk shit rattled like a baby hand
Except this toy cost eighty grand
And I'm crazy tan from all the places that I've been
Just from writing words with a pen
Tell the pilot Land the plane  on Roosevelt and Main
Put a jacuzzi on the seven train
And lay John Coltrane play with that cocaine face
I know your crabs from that Old Bay taste
The brass band was seven pieces my bitch's name is Peaches
We got twin Mac elevens with the features
Shit you barely got sneaker money
So much dick in their mouths that's why these motherfuckers speaking funny
You need to speak clearer dear 'cause I can't hear ya

The Magic Johnson of the game
These lames don't want to play with me
Smile on your face but I really know you hatin' me
I know you mad 'cause I'm sick and it's plain to see

Ride the Harley into the sunset
La musica de Harry Fraud
Smoke something biatch 

Blow a kiss to my dick wash my body with the sponge
Feed me Flavorices put the chronic in my lungs
Tailor me a leather suit on some Jodeci shit
Bi-coastal man we both will be rich

Leave the party with your daughter 
In the morning do karate in the water
Hear sounds of samurais
Rockin shorts in the winter don't fuck with splinters 
Roll with sinners yeah a bunch of winners catered lunch and dinners
Why my drug jar look so empty 
Long knife  that's in the event
Somebody try to get me then to Heaven they'll be sent
Oh off the strength caviar and Porsche taste
All the beans are gettin' Boston baked
On thin ice I skate across the lake
Smoke premium cabbage

Blow a kiss to my dick wash my body with the sponge
Tailor me a leather suit on some Jodeci shit
Bi-coastal man we both will be rich

Poppin' hood in Transco Towers
Prowler prowling Gucci towels and bathroom vials
Nouns owls Aston Martins
Sparkin' one in valet parkin' loan sharkin'
Hopin' that my days-don't-get-darkened
Cheetah skin outside the parka
Propaganda propels us ostrich feathers
Security guards with 9 berettas pullin' up Volkswagen jettas
Causin' storms in sunny weather in sunny whether in sunny weather
Hopin' that my days get hopin' hopin' days get days get better

Sign my name with the feather tap dance under the full moon
Smoke and drinking liquor for the fam that left us too soon
Just keep it truckin' searching all the nooks and crannies
No english muffin streets are filled with crooks and trannies
Emerald green paper that I split up with my posse
One hand driving 3 gram smoking
2 fiend sucking tea bag soaking
Strength of a retard the drugs are even stronger
Shorty loved the longitude dealer bring a quarter through
Over fishing make the snapper less affordable
I hate when stupid bitches ask me questions that's rhetorical
Do you want to have sex
Well bitch it's obvious
Her name was Jeta from the former Yugoslavia
She grew a bush like a baby plant
Still I ate it just think of it as bucatin' and razor clams
Smuggle cheeses in a baby bag
And then I serve at a private tasting
I got no time for wasting
Just dick is placed in the slit no type of conversation
Fuck fucked my last word up 'cause I don't give a shit man
I meant to say prime rib carved at the fucking carving station

Yo my mind is locked up my conscious rocked up
In an alley with a fiend getting his cock sucked
Plus she wearing a wedding dress a special day
She said she finally met a Fuck
Yo my mind is locked up my conscious rocked up
In an alley with a fiend getting his cock sucked
And she wearing a wedding dress a special day
She said she finally met a man to take her breath away
Well naturally I'm jealous because I'm lonely
At times my only friends in life are drugs and the cannoli
My dad was right I should have listened when he told me
A walking contradiction wounds inflicted on me solely
Ocean avenue the family straight from Kosovo
That was years ago mum look how your son has bloomed
I hum a tune and then I'm hotter than the sun in June
And I'm just living my life but feel I'm drifting
Demons on the doorstep lungs that feel constricted
Or maybe I should see a shrink and get prescripted
Or take the hand of God but shit I think i'll keep my distance
I think I'm frightened and I didn't even know it
But yo that was a thought and I'm subconsciously a poet
It's perfect timing and I hope that I don't blow it
I pop the bottle of the moet yo here's to me

Late nights I'm trying to stay up out of the orange skips
Great white sharks the magnum with tarnished tip
Twenty-seven years I never met an honest bitch
Slice their faces like Kitana and shit
Through my nasal blow the smoke
Basil on the boat
Hookers on the half shell hundred dollar pants
Wind breaker jacket flapping like a falcon from a westward wind
Play the kitchen like a mexican next of kin
Patrick Swayze We out 
Better slow down baby
I'm out here wildin'
Better slow down baby yeah shit is crazy

You need to slow down baby
My whole team cash and load out baby
I'm a hero in my home town baby
Stop talking just go down baby

Shit on my chest shoot colors like a care bear
All year see me tan hopping out the van
You wasn't there now you tryna show face
Fuck around be a cold case
Chrome skates on an old day
Remote control chains promote dough for the veins
Poke chicks hoes with vogue legs
Eat steaks off a gold plate stoned listening to Coldplay

Long knife by the spinal built like a rhino
Push the 635 to the finals
Pearl white like what you sniffin' in your sinus
The finest vaginas demolished by my dick
One year from Queens to the top
Cream of the crop serve a fiend out my sock
Five minutes till they lean like the drop
Now they spinning through the furnace like the scene from The Rock
Hide spinach like a doomsday prepper
Every Sunday in my Tuesday leather
Now my beard look like Uday and Qusay
Play the pool on a cool day

A lot of people with their hands out now
Got these motherfuckers mad 'cause I'mma stand out now
You never let the hammer off you got the soft hands
I hear you singing for the boss man dog
I'm from a lost land spill coke on the heater
Drop a little sauce on the beater
Zero to sixty in a Porsche like a cheetah
New York I'm like Jeter light Caesar
No hypebeaster rock a nice sneaker
You get drugs for a good price
My price cheaper guaranteed
My trunk snapping like a tambourine
Bodying these pussies with a camera team
You better slow down baby

You need to slow down baby
I'm a hero in my home town baby

White leather to the knee we in the tropics
Left hand is switching speeds
I'm in the cockpit
Straight from Flushing man we known for using chopsticks
Problems getting dealt with never pop shit
Hit you with the dropkick Marty Jannetty
Know I hit you with the dropkick Marty Jannetty
Know I hit you with that dropkick Marty Jannetty

Rock this Shawn Kemp kamikaze
Burning cheese Saganaki 
Greek shit whole team sick
Hoe bitches from Cleveland on my dick because I rap
Fuck it make it clap
Throw the money in the air then pick it up
I'll take that back bitch
Homie hold me down
Homie throw me phony pounds
The scent of dollars like some crispy garlic golden brown
Addicted but ain't nothing prescripted
Baby clams from Montauk mix it up with the linguistics
Bitch I'm high

White leather to the knee we in the tropics
Left hand is switching speeds
I'm in the cockpit
Straight from Flushing man we known for using chopsticks
Problems getting dealt with never pop shit
Hit you with the dropkick Marty Jannetty
Know I hit you with the dropkick Marty Jannetty
Know I hit you with that dropkick Marty Jannetty

Uh know I hit you with that hot shit
Straight up off the block roll up pot shit
Niggas just don't wanna go to school
Act like they are but they not sick
Money all up in my pocket putting diamonds in everything
See me out I look rich as fuck clothes smelling like Mary Jane
Ride coastal been on every plane
Say these guys close but these guys loco
When they see me they non-vocal
High as fuck I need bifocals
Kush got me moving slo-mo
Steak and eggs in my dojo
It's some Gs in there
Need some weed I'm there
All these cars I own ain't no keys in there
Tapping young niggas out rolling weed out an ounce
Now I got a bigger crib
Repping what I live about
My hair long my weed strong so they staring
My weed strong my money long I ain't caring

White leather to the knee we in the tropics
Left hand is switching speeds
I'm in the cockpit
Straight from Flushing man we known for using chopsticks
Problems getting dealt with never pop shit
Hit you with the dropkick Marty Jannetty
Know I hit you with the dropkick Marty Jannetty

What up love I need a hug 'cause drugs be takin' over
Shorty couldn't take it no more she went loca
No stranger to a rum and soda
I met the ho while she was slumped over
Shit I've been good though I can't complain
I could probably cop a half a plane
Drinking juice just like Jack LaLanne now
I'mma strike it rich any day now
Uh you know I gotta get a plate now
Virtuoso on a keyboard
I rep the eastern seaboard jeez Lord
Don't sneeze on my shit 'cause for shiz I'mma flip ya
Pedicured foot slide in the slipper
Tryna do the remix with Pitbull
Tell the pilot land at Schiphol
Play the violin with dimples
Life's ironic and it's simple
Smoke good fuck eat drink
Drive nice car wear all green mink
First time I whacked off was a Penthouse
Roses in the bath at the penthouse
Billy Joel at the garden
Choke a pussy with his tie knot it's my block
Chuck Knoblauch spicy coconut curry from the Thai spot
I'm in a hurry dumb jewelry
The verdict read from a hung jury
The doctor said that I was hung early
Skull curly Larry and Moe I'll marry a ho
Only if the bitch look like Mari' Monroe
Twisted off the Jenkem watching Iron Chef
The secret ingredient was lion's neck

No don't hurt me again
Please don't hurt me again
No don't hurt me again
There's no hit records on a demo
No don't hurt me again
There's no hit records on a demo
Catch me hoppin' out the limo

Smoke good fuck eat drink
Been on the honor roll sculptures of my body out in Nagano
My shawty features like Madonna-
I ain't like that one
Yo line for line
Straight up lambs on the arm Giambi lenses
Ken Caminiti Bosworth

Been on the honor roll sculptures of my body out in Nagano
My shawty features like Madonna Lo designer
Bending these young Lola Fellanas over
Baste the breast with the juices
Under the influence of fly shit I glide like Ovechkin
Disqus hoody puff hibiscus balance be the crispest
Baby girl you're wylin if you sniff this
You gotta take a piss test piss right through your fishnets
Robert Moses State Park lamb in the sand
Strictly cop and go's until we laid in the Galapagos
Eating tacos higher than a opera note
We never ride Civics the Mont Blanc scripted lyrics
It's like avant garde to the critics
I throw you in that armbar with the quickness
Either you with me or bitch you on the shit list

Bitch please picture me in Sicily
The hard bottoms gators is slippery
I just had an epiphany
And now I'm shittin' on your whole steez ridiculously
45. fire at ya attire to break your armor up like fine china
I hit the diner the Carolina
Pass the lighter to the passenger in the spyder
Vagina splash like apple cider
So fuck your little 2 cents blue benz bitches jump like Harold Miner
I'm in the recliner we traced like eye liner
And I escape like MacGyver
And lay up with a case of vodka
Get cake and prosper
Ate steak and lobster to Frank Sinatra
Air you out leave your face for pasta
Get laced and dip the jakes in the grey Boxster
Ladies identify gangsters' posture
I'm feeling like J Hoffa
Fuck yall eat a fat dick with the monster
Smoking that Barbara Walters wax
Same fucking outfit twenty days in a row I don't give a shit

You only came around 'cause you thought I had some money for you
You got it fucked up
That's for the kids
And If there's anything left I'll cop a crib
And If there's anything left after that I'll cop a six
How you think I got the art displayed on the dinner plates 
First course was from the Finger Lakes
Last course cinnamon ginger cake
She gave me head during the Laker game
I got her tatted trying to erase her name
No I caught her cheating her pussy didn't feel the same
She was probably with one of the Broncos
Or LeBron so I blew her car up
Soon as she try to start it up nah
I can't talk about that though
Your chance is thin like the moustache of Puerto Ricans
Shooting guns with my daughter on the weekend
Smoke the budder same color as The Weeknd
Stashed under the sole of the sneaker

The facial reminiscent of a lion
Fuck around I'll send you back to zion
And I ain't even trying
Swing the wood wheel like lumberjacks
I remember back when they wouldn't spend a stack on my rap
Now they want to wipe my ass in the crack after I shat
And I just had corn beef hash

Yeah It's me Motherfucking Big Body

You know I had come and to spice this shit the fuck up

We've been the best since I stepped in
Bring a hooker to the muthafuckin Jets Inn
In the sack break her back like a Redskin
Need the dough like I'm trying to get the bread thin
Tree to make the head spin
Every season play the corner like I'm Revis
Light Caesar heavy bearded like I'm Jesus
New York City Queens borough be the backdrop
I bring it back to all the benches need a blacktop
Big things see me moving like a Sasquatch
Money I'm in pursuit cuchillo inside the boot
Bitches are on display give brain inside the coupe
Shift gears that's with the left
Which means I'm on the right get paid
By any means you hold it say goodnight kid
Two fingers hold the potion when I'm smoking
Slow motion snatch a snapper out the ocean
In my lungs go the drugs like the red chief
Red leaf lettuce blood money on the bench seat
Twelve courses laid up on the long table
Aged wine got me spinning like a dreidel
For fly women use a condom 'cause it's fatal
Hazel eyed bitched always blazing up the basil
The red razor cut the features in your facial
Creep in Corona bumping Fernando Villalona
Puffing cheeba in the street by the chimi corner
Tu ne tappa me muthafuckas are sloppy
Captain of the rap you talking to papi
Up in Niagara Falls make your wifey suck a
Bag of balls it's sick just like a Magic cough
Same person on camera or when the muthafuckin' camera off
Hash straight from the desert can knock
A camel off Sheep straight out of school
Let the hammers off
Whole cliques roll thick no shit
Piss drunk and they smoke sticks
Not a word of English but
They hold the four-fifths
Nike jumpsuit sandals the whole shit
Young kids walking around got the Desi in hand
Never speak to fuzz
Tap out the reefer show him how
To use his sneakers 'cause
Roasted peppers sweet tomatoes heirloom
We on the beach fresh Ceviche
We in Cancun fly girly curly
Hair is getting read through
We in the shower give me head shampoo
Swimming trunk shoe accentuate the ankle
Eyes blue put the children's money in the Banco
Giuseppe Franco take the cash and tango
I'm straight stoned thank you
Bye peace one fuck you
Yeah fucking throw up on the floor shit
Get the cleaning lady
My bad Hey yo 

In only one year considered as a veteran
Top of the line the whip look like tropical lime
Off the boat cousin Glock by the spine
Do a murder seven thirty then they flying at nine
Shit 
Handspring half twist into the Buick
You say you're doing shit but never do it
I say I'm doing shit and then I do it
Never going back to work in labor
Fuck that your little chain you better tuck that
Uh vultures flying over the carcass
Bitches blowing on my dick like a cartridge
Throw some grass up aim a little east of the target
My brain was sculpted at Harvard
Never mention all the crime I been a part of
Serve like Ivan Lendl up in the rental
The cheese been assembled
They receiving health benefits and dental
The lamb was laced with fennel
Left hand then shift the right foot touched the pedal 

From now on I'm just the symbol
Hundred dollar drugs smoke out the window
Paper plates I never had a license
Could always catch me smoking spices
Triple lindy out the Jeep land into a split
Get up in the spin doggie I'm the shit 
You're staying broke like Maury with the hip
Huh catch me on Maury with my bitch
Fuck with me 

The whip gymnast
Jump out the car into the river
Don't splash on the dive
Straightforward money cash on the side
If you catch him I want that bastard alive
My bitch's ass is like an apple
You bitches see me look astonished
Your boy is ill with the phonics
Since Gary Payton had the pill for the Sonics
You're still a novice
And to be brutally honest your shit is garbage 
Dog I've been a scholar
My shoes are still alive from Lake Victoria
Fuck the order up leave you stretched in the corridor
I got my aura up hoes that drive me in foreign truck 
One is riding me the other one is rolling up 
Pray to science they don't pull me over
If they do then the fun is over
Whether young or older motherfucker's been a musket holder
Just sprinkle cheese on top of me and let it get crusted over 

Straight from the depths of Queens
Leave you sleeping on the mezzanine
Like you Lincoln then switch into a desert scene
Often heard but this motherfucker seldom seen
I'm throwing blows while you waiting for the bell to ring
Drug smoking
Raisins make the pasta sweet
Slumped over when the barrel and your posture meet
Stay lean like some motherfucking ostrich meat
You full of shit it's time to get a colonoscopy
Scissor kicks dick suck from Miss Elizabeth
Lex Luger arms
4 in the morning in the dark with the computer on
Wasting my time my thoughts are paced untastable grace replaced in my mind
Born to shine like the eyes on a cat
Same cat fuck around put the knife in your back
This is nothing we live and let die and roam the land
And you bluffing
You lifted the cards and showed your hand pussy

Take my nuts out your mouth
Let me breathe for a minute please
Your life is cheap like a hooker in the Philippines
About to be a huge star and I'm still in Queens
You're on the shelf like a figurine
Drugs infested my mind
But I'm destined to shine
Spit the shit to keep these motherfuckers pressing rewind
Thousands of pounds of pressure pressed on your spine
Live divine free the mind lead the blind read the signs
Hands up like you stepping in the party
No you getting robbed motherfucker with the shotty
Said you pottyd
Make your body do an ollie
Then dig your shorty out 'cause I geeked her up on molly
Have her eating dick no need for seasoning
If seven dudes are in the room then she's pleasing them
Like a trooper Hit her in the pooper Throw her in the shower
Then I take her out to Lupa
I'm kinky I'll hit it even if it's stinky
Put em in the shower make the pussy brand new
Ran through
Give 'em money what I can't do
Stuff her lunchbox and burn her with the candle

Don't get me pissed off fuck around rip your tits off
Still getting head even if my dick's soft
Rising quick no Fleischman's
I'm in the endzone with one leg up posing like Heisman
Throwing like Theismann sway foot
With the Village Leader smoking a pipe with seven wise-men
I eat the biggest piece of chicken at the table
Let 'em know I'm hungry
Polo on the rugby
The forty-four long surely got a trusty home
Trying to live American DreamsDusty Rhodes
Get it together Justin got to get it together fam
Let's go fucking pussy

Yeah fuck the back talk
Save all that pussy shit for the cat walk
Now write your name hundred times on the blackboard
Just a white man excelling in a Black sport like I'm Pistol Pete
You already know you a goner when I kiss your cheek
Lift your feet like when your sister sweeps
Fine dining drink water out the crystal creek
Straight from Queens rocking leathers like I'm Mr. Cheeks

Yo I'm a wild freak hit shorty where the child sleep
While her mother make soup with the cow feet
Shoulder pads and a leather Beau Brummell
Hopping out the limo at the old Tunnel
Fuck sex on the beach I want head in the streets
Spread bed on the feet
Lead on your cheek the cadillac from seventy-three
Aqua marine with a popular fiend uhh
Big Bird Farrington alumnus
Mouth like a pussy she gum dick

You see me in the green velour facial conquistador
Then I order up a feast for four
If you see me in a leather know it's reaching the floor
Linen flapping in the wind 'cause of the breezy shore yeah
Spinal tap you spitting gynecology rap
Eat your pussy with a plastic bag covering that
Brothers will clap leave you hovered or jacked
If there's chicken in the building know I'm smothering that
This tool I got will loosen up your stool a lot

Ginger ale laying in a Knicks cup
Pay thirty dollars for a dick suck
Pay a hundred dollars for the joints I rolled
Oyster bowls chilling in the cloisters
I love Black girls boisterous
Shorty's on the arm like a koi fish
On a herby white dude with the yellow fever
Yellow sneakers see through yellow beeper

Banging seven gram rocks and finishing them
Because that's how I roll I have one speed I have one gear

When our eyes first met was like the fourth day in July
When you kissed my lips I knew one day you'd be mine

Watch my shorty take a shower I want the good loving
Six ducks in a wood burning oven
Georgia Southern her alma mater
She raised out in Queens but moved out to Colorado
Looney Tunes Taz on the shirt
Fuck swag got pizzazz
Two jags Cincinnati Zubaz
Du rag Bay Terrace pool pass
Talked to Skip schooled me on the ponies
Next year catch me posing at the Tonys
Grow the money like a Cocha tree

American flags hang on walls that hide money
Put my arm through the Picasso
Kept a fortress crib got the Tex-Mex motif wolves howling
Two stallions pull the buggy Clydesdale
Crack the Bud guzzle humidors
Uncle Moozy with the Mitsubishi
Uncle Jimmy with the funny money flossing out in AC
Randy Quaid with the turtleneck
Erma with the jungle juice man feet
Beamer tan seats
Smack the taco out your mouth green couch
Sittin' first class feelin' like shit though
Starin' out the window with the mind of a schizo
Thinkin' if I jump will I feel it when I hit the ground 
Fuck that I want the crown off anybody head
I wouldn't care if everybody's dead
It's why I keep the pump shotty layin' in the bed
Have a fuckin' sleepover with my weapons
My Rambo knife is eatin' nuggets with my nine
Shit I made this out of nothin'
Damn these ladies love me out in London
Laurenivici served the granulated onion
My mind is locked in a contaminated dungeon
Dog what the fuck is with your mother 
She got one leg longer than the other
One eye through the shutter
Made the transition from weed to butter like spring to summer

I nearly lost my mind
I nearly lost my brain
Dealin' with this motherfuckin' pain so bad
So bad I'm so glad
I nearly lost my mind

My past life I was a Rabbi
Now I live the fast life
Drugs on standby in the circle by the campfire
Telling stories of yesteryear
Pull out the pocket mirror just to check my hair
Hit it with the comb again
The rap Dennis the Menace with Dennis Rodman's in Venice inventive
She took a bump and started dancing like Elaine Benes
The big chain sway like I'm playing tennis
One man team about to win the pennant
Now you can tell by my pendant that I'm protected
Pull me in the room and ask if its resin
I said no they sent me on my way with blessings

I trained a dolphin to let the slammer off like Dolph Lundgren
That's if your mouth running
You'll get your cow something
I'm rare like a fucking Asian playing hockey
My ocean view is due to Papi
Bitches call me Rodney
Bought my bitch a present hope I don't spoil it
Face to face toilets
Toyota with the spoiler Ace of Base boiling
I play ball like Billy Hoyle
Now I need a Sidney Dean to help me start this brothel in the Philippines
I stay in Flushing like I'm Dillon Gee
You ain't gotta open up the comic book to figure who the villain be
It's me doing perfect dives in the Sicilian sea
You know I like my bitch with a Brazilian V
Bumping Bobby Brown
Cry when I'm not around
She always hold it down pound under the seat
In that all white Jeep
Sleep that's if you wanna
I be schwitzing in the sauna
Its better than the piggys blitzing on the corner
Come in the crib every night and I kiss my daughter
Same lips spit on the lawyer

Dropkicks out the drop-top 6
Don't make your fucking kid become a hostage I got this
Stay in the water like the Loch Ness
Shirtless rocking a locket
Drugs in my pocket
It's all for a profit
Aim it and pop it drive in a range in my boxers
Lay in the tropics my girl pussy red like a lobster
Orgies at Hofstra
My bank account is like a Polish doctor
My heart is cold I sing a soldiers opera
My drugs as strong as Arnold
They found her dead in the gold Impala
Hanging backwards out the chopper
The room smell like Nag Champa
Most my crew a bunch of armed robbers

Yeah I rhyme sick like I play with shit
I've driven every flavored whip there is to get
Feel like I dip that cigarette in wet stuff
I should be on that Sped Ed bus layin' on the bed with a red head slut
These mother fuckers praying that I don't make it
I'm on the balcony stoned and naked playing Sega
No money nothing to say to ya
I push the limo to the stadium
Me and Spike had to switch seats
'Cause he kept spilling Henny all on my bitch feet
Expensive bracelets where my forearms and my fists meet
Down in Mexico eating chilis

No emotions lotions on the bed sheets
I saw her walking 'cause I'm stalking on the dead streets
Trying to purchase where the shoulders and the head meet
She had a tight pink dress her pussy was a weapon
Said she was a daughter of a Reverend
Well thank god I don't believe in heaven
Butt cheeks sculpted like a horse's hind
Shit man I think that I just crossed the line
Annual abortion time
Yeah she got the tat straight from West 4th
Hereditary cancer almost took her breast off
And over 6 months she said she had a chest cough
Well I'm not a doctor but I know that's not a good sign
Matter of time 'til she placed and laced in a wood pine
For years she was the hood slime
Now no longer having a good time
Under earth she burst into a sudden birth
Oh shit the facial of my cousin Murph
Strange occurrences alignment with the sun and earth yeah
As baby turtles break the sand just to figure out the meaning
Instinctively they heading towards the water 'cause they need it
Forever cycles stay the same they feel it like a fiend's wrist
Mustard straight from Russia that they brought in on a steam ship
My mustache like a Colonel
Take a haters facial and I treat it like a urinal
A bit disturbed confessions in a journal
I'm sickened by my thoughts so it's tossed in the inferno
Statik Selektah
Playing through the broken ankles man
Never sit down 'cause I'mma stand up

Book a ticket to the tropics 'cause I'm through with all the shit
That I'm living every day in the mirror saying why me 
Hide my eyes 'cause I'm sickened with the image
Of using marijuana sipping vintage for the time being
My skills set is very serious in fact
Spit a wild rap carve a steak right off the cow's back
Throw it on the grill I'm cooking in a suit
Same shit that's on the grill gave me leather for the boot
If they make me take the stand then I'm lying through my teeth though
Ask to swear to God but in that I don't believe though
My man Stevie Mo playing safety for Toledo
Hustle 'til my fingers staying cheesy like a cheeto
Drug roll precise like a hooker with the dice
Butcher with the knife you get tooken for your life
So much to say it's so little time and shitty
Killer Queens the borough New York be the city
Coming crazy out your mouth will get your split up like a philly
Running through the maze like I'm Willie you gotta feel me

I'm moving forward 'cause nothing's gonna be the same
Eyes blurry from the smoke I can't see the lane
Swerving heavy bottle in my lap
I'm looking for a problem so I'm modeling the gat
Somebody save me 'cause I don't wanna go to jail
I'd rather be up in the mansion for the polo sale
But I'm here stuck inside my thoughts
I'm tryna have a bag of money stuffed inside my shorts

My life is like a movie Blizzard with the shottie
Hookah house on Roosie chilling in the lobby
Yes I'm living gnarly the forty ounce of Barley
Open up cigars and fill 'em with a bunch of Marley
Double cut porterhouse straight from Luger's
Ruger for intruders hand to hand made by the duelers
Ginger ale in Knicks glasses your style is piss mothafucka
Time to flip the mattress kick it swift as Cassius
My mind is stronger than Mariusz Pudzianows
Obvious to see I'm a star straight off the couch
You rapping with a blouse you get slapped up side the mouth
By the Zangief look-a-like Bronson always cooking right
Spray the vinegar to tighten up a yummy
Smoking got me squinting like the sky is high and sunny
Attachment on the nozzle make the iron fire funny
Never stop until my body diving in a pile of money

I'm always smoking like a gunshot
You know the fuzzy light green call it Dunlop flow nun's twat
Many hours one man standing one spot
From the morning to the mothafuckin' sun drop
'Cause I'm one with the Earth eyes red
Mothafucka I've been blunted since birth age 9
Mom dukes kept the gun in the purse next to the hair spray
Fuck tomorrow money coming in the fast way

Yeahthrough the eyes of a G
Through the eyes of a G see me in the all white Eclipse
A husband pay me ten stacks to fuck his bitch
Hand up her ass like a Muppet baby it's crazy
While she do a buck-eighty in a mustard Mercedes
I move the mustard from Russia to Haiti
Forty-fives will kiss your neck like the touch from a lady
Fuck with my lunch and then the pump leaves you under the daisies
You know your bitch is just another cocksucker with rabies
I'm signing autographs in Spanish I live with Michael Jackson's anguish
Hop in the Vanquish and vanish off the manor in a strange manner
Aim the hammer at your dame's bladder like it ain't matter
I smoke 'til I got down syndrome
Tan gators brown linen
Multi-color money seven different kinds of cheeses
My silhouette resembles Jesus in all seasons
Take a ginger shot doing concentration curls with the cinderblocks
Doing squats hope the ox don't drop out
Don't make me have to slap the fire out your pop's mouth

Through the eyes of a G
'Cause I get bored with niggas talking 'bout
Who they used to be what they used to do
My homie headed to court not for a two-on-two
Ironically I'll have you know we do it for the sport
Or at least to keep a little gold in this uniform
I'm abnormal like a unicorn that you could get on
Cows jump over moons when my nouns and verbs move
Etiquette of a veteran still getting checks
You get a F for your efforts we never trade techs
I tried to keep the peace but now I gotta keep the piece
I speak in synchronistic frequency with triggers squeezing
And one day I'll drop to my knee and repent to Jesus
'Til then I'm humping my lust demons for no reason
Know you broke my heart woman
When you said goodbye to me
You say goodbye to me bitch you better break North
Before you six South and I'll be sitting in that big house

Just let me sharpen my knives thrown on the apron
X's mark the steak and the salad crumbled with bacon
And bleu cheese caramel complexion's on two knees
Or two skis carving up the Alps is what this dude needs
I'm Rick the Model Martel to cartel
Live fast and eat the big tuna like Billy Parcells
No more child's play kid you with the big boys
Fuck an economy size we want that big Royce
My family's sayin' that I rhyme with fury
Only focus on them hundred bill faces and suitcases
That'll bribe a jury grind the curry never shine the jewelry
Pussy like an eighty-six style you know it's fine and furry
Spark the bark in the park you know lumberyard
You ain't never in the limelight undercard
Bronsolini in the sky thunder rod
Commandante of this rap shit your Mossad killer

The second stanza even deadly than the first
From the birth I've been enlisted to plant seeds in the earth
That's soon road to a valley that feeds civilization
I'm walking the torrid land though I'm seeking my vindication from
My bad I'll keep it fifth grade keep the switchblade
Hilfiger sailin' apparel and plus a crisp fade
First day class the Agassis are black and white
My older cousin puffing pot bitch pass the pipe
Now I'm a certified user more like abuser
Slice and dice the music I'm fluid like the yakuza
I'm Sanders whether Deion or Barry find candy
Though I smoke until my eyes are the shape of Tia Carrere
My team we work as a unit nobody hide the ball up
Great intuition and vision no time to hit the mall up
Just a taste of the life like a September call up
Johnnie Walker in our tall cup getting torn up
Listen I'm steel fisted with the iron lung
Heavy metal ballads out the guitar with lion's run
Praise the son that can stand on his own two
Smoke on the big blunt take a sip of this home-brew

She had the sweetest scent I ever smelt a woman have
Skin would glisten like reflections off the blueish Jag
She had a Jewish dad and a Jamaican maid
Started hanging with strippers and dropping the zippers
And selling the pussy for paper to play
Crusty feet like she hiking for days and live in the mountains
At the park she piss in the fountain shit on the Michigan towel
She quick to split up an owl
She loves some dick in her bowels
Dabble in crystal polish the pistol powder her sniffles with flour
Straight flieshman
In the private part of her pussy pocket
Randomly pussy farting
Sold at the hookers auction
Left as a crooked orphan
Wrapped in the sports section
Box score fake black rubber cock in the top drawer what

Yo so many unfamiliar faces that have come and gone
You're a constant fucked you in the school closet
We were young then experimental periods
Laid a towel 'cause I fucked you on your period
Stole my mothers car crashed it by the Burger King
Young love but we thought it was eternity
Raw sex never thought about paternity
But now this cunt is trying to murder me
Abusing me physically and verbally
Said my dick was too small
I went and got the surgery just to show it off
This ain't real shit baby I'm just going off
Clear the mind fuck it so I wrote a song
Night life I'm destined for the bright lights
Knife fights at the bar with some white dykes
She hold me down break a bottle on the bitch head
We always end up in a situation
She throwing diapers out the window at me
Called the cops said I beat her face
Beat the case now I shiver at a sweet embrace

I rap now bitches sucking like a vacuum
On the bed stay bent like a smack spoon
Bubble butt thicker than the double dutch
In the van leave her tied up in bumblefuck

Cold tired and I mean it
I thought we'd grow to old farts in Phoenix
Well now you see me 'lo scarves and a ski knit
But I've been here since the beginning like a prefix
But I'mma to do what I gotta do
Trying to make this french dough like a Pâte à Choux
Over your head after sex shorty hold me in bed
Smoking Ethiopian red
The son goes a single teardrop fallopians bled
Nowadays you catch the hooker sniffing coke in the shed
It's a damn shame I'm just chilling eating lamb brain
I keep the weiner on display for the campaign

I'm just doing what I had to do
Tryna Drop me in the ground but I'm not going
To the top till I fall just like Owen
Heartbreak drowned sorrows in a large steak
Fuck that sitting-down rap type shit man
I stand up 'cause I'm a motherfucking man
And I'm motherfucking hot

I'm on the third floor your class was in the basement
You know what that means you got a hint of retardation
Well me too I'm fully-blown just like the flow though
Spit the silky shit that's ankle-length like a kimono
Uh sharp instruments to rock like a fossil
Shotty for the haters that's trimmed off at the nostrils
Well me and Docker eating dinner at the brothel
Never sniff that blanco that's word to OJ's Bronco
Cop a Dutch and break it open overfill it
I'm rollin' in the car it may be shaky never spill it though
'Cause when I rhyme I feel possessed by El Espirito
Encounters of a Third Kind X-Rays on the visual
Ginger ale and hot sauce two things I live by
I'm such a chill guy but fuck around and yes you will die
Green DeVille right green drugs but hold the serum
Rub the things together then you clear 'em flatline
The prosciutto olives from Tunisia
Drums are hittin' hard because they chopped up like a cleaver
And yes I'm smokin' all the reefer
The night creeper
I love the pussy really tight that's with a light Caesar
Can it be that I'm the Golden Child the chosen one
The piggies saying freeze but every time they did I chose to run
Takin' that attachment on the nozzle like a soldier's gun
Hide behind the boulder silver bullet through you shoulder son
Crack the pepper over thin crust that's handmade
I'm stayin' strapped just like the Air Raid
Yo take a taste of my nuts
Know they sweet just like the candy
Dick is the same color as Band-Aid understand me 
I built this building they came and then I conquered
Two hour flights to Heathrow up in the Concorde
Fermented grapes up in my glass that bear the same name
I'm working hard because that's what I need to maintain
Killer Queens is on the rise so understand me
Ain't never stoppin' 'til there's a Grammy in a room for my family
Also known as a den
Post and toast with Lauren
Posing for pictures kicking scriptures that form up a phlegm

Uh let me take a little break fam
I'm fucking straight out of surgery man
I need a little break
When I come back in I'mma come back in hard though
I promise you that

I'm diving in like Louganis
I'm aiming right for that anus
Trying to give her a payment to rent the pussy like Avis
My rhymes are seasoned for flavor
Fuck with shorties that's in shape they got the V like they're Vader
Ah ha Animal Style flippin' like a flipjack
You heard the cat rap like animal's fear from a rat got
Ankle length that's suede the jacket
Do the Chatatimmy Shimmy like a crackhead
No one compare to me lampin' with my tangerine
I'm fiend out so I'm bangin' on the tambourine
Yo bring the drugs and call me when you on the corner
And I'mma send the doja down in case they run up on ya
Your style is celibate I'm elegant trust
My style is liver and I'm ivory like a elephant tusk
Swirl the wine inside the glass that got the delicate musk
Shoe be pointy at the toe closin' down the show
Poison be the flow got the boysenberry blow
Finish on the women
That mean the bitch from Finland
Her tits are bonkers
Chilling in her chanclas
Rollers in her hair I'm running through it Larry Csonka

You don't even know who fucking Larry Csonka is man
Get the fuck off my wee-wee
Pussy
Jungle Rule can't be no fool

Twisting joints like a contortionist
Laid in the Porsche
My father driving
Days been sunny since I started rhyming
No denying me I'm known to keep a fresh foot like podiatry
Nobody high as me
Green Timbs in Vegas I'm like Steve Wynn
At the same time fellatio from three twins
Those are triplets I've been wilding since the Rabbi snipped it
Then they laughed and ate brisket fuck 
On my behalf he had a meeting at the Neptune
Had little daddy hide the heater in the restroom
Guns drawn like my bath by my lady friend
Mesothelioma money drop Mercedes-Benz
And I ain't never left you know I'm still here
Spit the shit to bring a cripple out the wheelchair
Bite a bitch like George Whipple in the stair case
Long as she got big nipples and a tan face

Devil is on the loose no coop

Foul living like Sandusky and Paterno
I've been husky motherfuckers couldn't touch me
'Lo rugby with an Asian model so ugly
Facially I'm like a young John Kennedy
Take the money cop 5 dimes 2 chicken sandwiches 9 limes
For the Canada Dry pose for the cameras by the banister
In the summer rock the vest set Salmon Kani
Flex the three-quarter cream Fi's
We're summer seam G's steamed red snapper Vietnamese
Catch a case get a Jewish lawyer beat it with cheese
Fuck the beef 'cause it don't go together read em and weep

Your boy been eating on the run clearly
Clear the run-way
So much drugs what would a nun say
And its Sunday
Shit I don't really give a fuck
All I really want to do is see my people up
Up to no good again
She threw the condom told me put it in
I nutted in like three strokes
Shit now that's no way to rep the East Coast
Every day I'm walking with my head up
Don't let up 'cause it's a set-up
Like Albanian marriage go from Haiti to Paris
The bath was ninety degrees
Tapping Heinies with ease 
Bitch please I'm the bee's knees
Peep the landscape
You can catch me in the trees like the shit for the pancakes
Yo pass me the ball fool

Straight the fuck up I roof this shit
Fuckin' three-sixty on this pussy

I'll kick this motherfucking ball over the fence

I know you see me on the TV lookin' like a hunk of beef
When I smile your baby mama shit her dungarees
Somebody get the kid a deal he sound like me
But nah dunny don't get down like me
The falcon flies back to the glove when I whistle
Don't try to put me in the box like a tissue
'Cause I push you in the box with a pink suit
Fuck around and have some squid ink soup bitch
 
Uh you ain't a legend like Yanni
I'm so Queens like a Roy Wilkins T-shirt
With one arm shredded and one arm missing
Dog I was born with Allah's vision
I learned quick I couldn't follow suit
'Cause the Devil put the pork inside the dollar soup
Now I'm sittin' in first class with a hard dick
Listenin' to German guitar riffs what a life
I was made like the beginning of Jurassic Park
When they took the fucking blood from the mosquito with a dope needle
Then they shot it in a wild lion
I popped out holdin' an iron with a visor on
Yo the videos are like a Jewish summer camp promo
Your ideas lack Adobo

Yo silk cinder blocks cinnamon socks
On the low like a whip without shocks
I bag bitches in flocks
Representative for everything official
Ya'll niggas can't live so it's officially an issue
Waterproof penmanship padded on a rugby
Hammer in the hamper 'case a nigga try to thug me
I'm a idol my wave is tidal forget survival
Treat the last record I broke just like a rival
Uh I'm New York before it turned into a bike lane
Never had a light fame split the pipe cane
It was written but I wrote it
Put religion right on my neck and then I froze it
Laurenovitch yeah

Location a drug infested area Brooklyn New York
What am I doing Standing on an unidentified corner
With a Latin individual corn rows foamposites 
All sorts of a felony in his waist
But who are you She only loves me when I'm naked
That's right I built this shit
Drop that shit

Let me begin baby my name is Drake
All I see is C-notes silk shirts at the casino
It's time to take those leather pants off this ain't no dance off
I know your hands soft you're on the menu like the lamb broth
This is a grown man's sport
And dog I leave a motherfucker laid out on the handball court
I never brag and boast I'm fire out the dragon's nose
My words pronounced just like a camel toe
And every whip in the garage laced
Keep that thing in the guitar case bait the cops into a car chase
Crash the mother fucking Jeep into the venue
You better pray to God it's straight to Heaven where they send you
Ah why the fuck would I have a bodyguard
If I look just like the mother fucking bodyguard
Baby hair curls on my forehead leave your whore dead
Hop out that four times four door and draw lead
I'm underground and I need more bread
And I need more head from some bitches straight from Morehead
State your business 'cause I'm busy tanning naked
My joint is shaking while I'm wearing bracelets
Uh your words are tasteless your taste is basic
My taste in Asics will lead your fucking spaceship into Matrix
This place I made is quite spacious
And dog I'm not the one to fucking play with

Five-fifty pounds in the Laredo they gotta get there today though
Ain't no time for tryna lay low bay bro
If you can't do it all you gotta do is say no
I'll take it from there Ace is on Grand ready to work it
Displayed a smirk like Mr. Perfect
Under the bridge behind the van in the cab I made the drop off
Thank science that nothing popped off since I was young had a lust for foreign vehicles and things
My father wore the ring when he pushed me in the swing
Plus he pushed that red thing I wanted to be like him so bad
Wear the same shoes that he stepped in of course I need paper
I want to ride the one-seater like speed racer
In the Jetta smoking a one sheet in the green acres
Listening to bullshit music thinking how I'm gonna do this

I'm from a place called the jungle where the living is rough
It had me low for a while now I'm picking it up
Holding the spot straight sticking it ripping it up
I dropped ninety-nine problems switching and not giving a fuck
So what you what you want Got your bitch nigga gripping her butt
Her and my dick taking pics nigga flicking it up
My click is wassup get buck if you want 
You end up dumped chump in the pond lake in a truck in New York
There's no ducking me the Bada$$ time but no fuckery
Won't find a chick who got a dime or take a single buck from me
These hoes be loving me I keep it so G
Respecting where I be nigga check your OG
My rap flow imperial fad flows
Well here it go my visions is linear when I'm ripping the video
It's a lyrical miracle when I enter your stereo
The rarest breeds sick like venereal diseases

Killing to live fighting for something
Too bad we don't know what it is
What you think all of this cash for 
Trying to put stamps on my passport
Man I'm just scheming on new hoes
I already forgot about my last broad

It's like the world we live in was only designed for
I know you want from the first time you seen me in the movie
Hanging on the shoulder of a villain
She could flatten a village
You know I'm usually chilling out with Bruce Willis
Somehow you and my man met first
I was still stealing the money outta my gram-gram's purse
Running the streets letting the blam-blam work
Back then we smoked nickels of dirt
Nowadays it ain't shit to drop a grip on dessert
And you wanna tell the feds about some shit and it hurts
Fuck it so be it you 'bout to know Jesus
Turn this motherfucker back into a fetus
Phone's tapped so speak Swedish when you call the crib
Rich forever motherfucker I was born to live
Die happy knowing that my family's straight
I hope they didn't see the numbers on that Camry plate

Front flips off the roof like a stunt double
My shorty doing kegels for her cunt muscle
Keep her shaped up
The M3 all green fly like a strange duck
My dad was right when he said I was a deranged fuck
Now every meal is calamari and boudin blanc
Saddam Hussein guns
Held by nuns who do drugs while beige hard bottoms slide on the new rug
Pinky up
The joint thicker than Pinky's butt
Just as stinky
Nick Van Exel with the handle Helsinki
Eggs Rothko
The handmade suit cloth hang out the sports coat
Twenty three and a half feet on the sports boat
Brown vest made of suede on my torso
Close my eyes inhale deep sail free
Blind fury hoppin' out the braille jeep
Serve me snails to eat

Just came back check my motherfucking emails
Got more motherfucking deals on the table
Don't even know what the fuck to do now

I'm relyin' on Viacom to keep my lights and fire on
Made a deal with Lucifer said give me the universe
It hurts kind of like losing your first love
I saw the bright lights and started doing the worst drugs
Now I'm backtracking and hash rappin' with Action
Throwing hand grenades at paddywagons in passing
Old fashioned soul grabber snorting all the coke up
The type of shit to turn a World War into a Polka
Polo'd up the double RL icon
Steppin' out the limo tuxedos made of python
Listening to Lionel Richie fuckin with the lights on
Rice on the table have us going all night long 
Rooftops sippin on some red wine
Start to realize I've been trippin shit its just fine
So I read a passage out the Bible as I take a bath
Dry off Hit the Colosseum on Jamaica Ave
Bout to say fuck it and form a union
March up to city hall and protest pollution 
I got a brand new car

Steer the yacht with my knee plenty of botany
Damn bad chick on top of me pornography
And I know she only want me for my guapery

Yo fuck this jacket I turn this shit to eighty-five napkins
Since Jeter's done I'm now the captain
Trust you me Gotham's safer now
But there's always a new joker in town
Ready to smoke you with that pound
But when he shoots it the flag says bang and everybody laughs
He must be up and off the molly tab
I'm by the bar lookin' Swedish in the trenchcoat stupid
The only one drinkin' mango lassi in the bullpen
My lips are sealed like the singer with bad skin
My need for speed made the Jag spin
Dog I'll resurrect Freaky Tah to do my ad-libs
Overseas I prolly got mad kids

Nothin' lasts forever or does it Fuck it
Shout out to my cousins all of 'em

I got a brand new car
I got a jazz guitar

I'll take it back to playin' handball and smokin' on the park benches
Dippin' cabs and hoppin' fences
Laughin' all the way back to the buildin' runnin'
Got to the door twist the key elevator waitin' for me
Hundred got upstairs and fixed eleven bowls of Crispix
Grabbed a Snapple out the bin no one's an even match for the kid
Legs are made of stone the back of a bridge
In goal line situations I'll tackle the fridge
Peace to Mike Ditka fifty on the light fixture
Right side shifter fight fixer twist your sister
And I ain't talkin' 'bout the hair band mothafucka

I can't even get this fuckin' right are you kidding me
I'm ashamed of myself I'm sorry
Fly Mary in to sing to that cow before we slaughtered it
And then I ordered it

Don't say a word to me
You already committed perjury
A bunch of lies and sneaks and I don't play that
You know better you better save that

Laid by the pool my legs gettin' massaged by a professional
Strictly business nothin' sexual
Seasonal vegetables lookin' exceptional
You ain't think I was hot then now you wanna hum on my testicles
I'm from a dirty borough where that Sun don't come out
But when the moon come and the goons come the crew runs
Like a big Jamaican I stand adjacent
My time gon' come I'm headed to the top
Like I never wore makeup and I'm ready for the spotlight
You know I got my hoodie on and it's such a hot night
Shit I'm straight from Queens catch me in the limo like it's prom night

You already committed perjury
A bunch of lies and sneaks and I don't play that
You know better you better save that

This that do a hundred in the rental in the rain
With the jammy a day before I have to go to Spain
Livin' on the edge different colored women in my bed
Different  colored linens on my leg
My mother said I better win or else she'll fuck me up
Ma we did it I love you lucky slut
Since I was young I had the husky gut
But I'm gorgeous got money in the pouch just like a tourist
Swerve in a Skylark big piece of the pie chart

You know better you better save that

Cindy she not herself unless she smoking crack
7 times she got stabbed in the back
By a regular john she dealt with many times before
Thats what she gets for being a whore though

With the zipper damn I know her kitty hurt
Ten hour shifts she thinking' bout retiring
She'll suck a Jewish lawyer or an African cabby

Spit the marvel with the soft top not the hard shell
Three shades of green suit hat and matching lizards

Dos en el morning rocking sweatpants ya know what up
Slowly approaching animals in motion
Pussy safari twenty for a lay
Ten for a blowjob but free for some free base
Before I purchase I wanna peek at the turkey
Make sure that its perky so it won't turn my dick to jerky
Open the door soon as she sat down she took a bump
She caught the rush then made a hooker grunt
Let's talk about me I'm always on the road
Got a little dick many of the secrets I behold
Name is dano born in the Bronx half Puerto Rican
Drive a truck hooked on dope cook a soul
Was once a prospect for the twin now im on a mission
Cryin naked shootin dope up in the kitchen
Falling asleep right on the shitter
Word to Roberto Clemente dog I'm still a hitter yeah 
Fuck the light at the end of the tunnel
'Cause I'm living for today trying not to drown in a bottle
Death all around me drugs seem to numb me
Mental's getting sicker the Devil's getting comfy
Acupuncture with the smoke like I'm Mason Storm
Legs crossed like a Buddhist smoking Buddha
Angry tuna chilling getting brain from Uma
Used to lose now everybody kangaroos
Hop off the schnitzel see me on Kissena
Smoke the marijueena always been the same guy
Whether balling on a yacht or hauling from the cops
I'm flooring on the Fox 'til I'm swelled up in a box
All you gotta do is see me when you see me
I'm burning bitches from the TV like a CD
So you could nibble on my pee-pee
We out in Fiji

From having money on my mind to having money in my pocket
Bone marrow roasted
Spread it on the rosemary bread lightly toasted
Drizzle with the vinaigrette
Stuffed Duchess and it's pulling like a cigarette

Until I'm tan skinned bitches saying that I'm handsome
'Bout to be up on the screen like Ted Danson
Suede loincloth never fall off
Mr. Wonderful Paul Orndorff
Leather jacket knee length
Peace to people getting money in the eighties with the freebase
First time you get a free taste
That's the start of a career chase I'm eating cheese plate
Skirt steak shaved straight up off the diaphragm
Muay Thai title fights out in Thailand
I spit the fly shit accompanied by fly bank
Use the flows that have me diving up in thighs tan
Purple rain no Prince summer solstice
Dope body but her pussy's like an old fish
The antipasti is a cold dish
Yo I'm focused catch me out in London speaking Polish
When I'm alone
Smoking weed sitting by the window in my home
Often thinking why the fuck is it I'm not in Rome
If I had a little motivation money and a hot body
I see it now Bronson the heart-throbby
No more pigging out binging on the late night
No more sneaking juice in the syringe to get the game tight
No more pack of hot dogs on my neck right by the fade right
Forty pounds to go and then you hookers getting laid right
I'm eating salad but I'm leaving off the croutons
'Cause ever since a youth your dog's huskier
Savings on the cookies mommy clipping out the coupons
Passing out from over-eating sleeping on the futon
Lock the refrigerator there's no controlling me
Steak and chocolate got they muthafuckin hold on me
Ain't trying to be laid in a box roses on me
Bronsolino running 5 miles for the glory

You motherfucker you fuck you

From philly cheesesteaks lobsters on the barbeque
I'm getting twisted eating chicken with a prostitute
An hour later eat the burger with my drug dealer
Then add the butter to the fudge to make the fudge realer
Every five minutes look in the fridges as if magic happened
Sneak a cookie rip the bag and fix the plastic wrapping
I don't want know one to know that I took it
'Cause I'm an over-eater 
Life is a smorgasbord to me and I'ma over do it
I wanna wear Italian clothing but it just don't cut it
Not the type that show the package with the crystal studded
The shit they model in Milan that's looking crispy custom
5 and 6 bitches lickin' my dick twitches
Serve up a facial Mister Belding bitches dismiss 'em
For now I'll take what I can get till this shit switches
Whatever fuck you stupid bitch
Peace to the Drums of Heaven
Peace to beef ribs
Extended lunch time I eat enough for three kids
Go on a diet then fall off because I'm weak kid
Since I was young I'm eatin' candy on the sneak tip
My day is based upon fine drugs cholesterol
Though at my height and weight im probably still the best at ball
I'm tatted up I have no shame to show the chest at all
I bet I have your lady humming on my testicles

Yeah Bronsolino
Bout to be fuckin summer time in the winter
Shirtless
Ayo you ready Yeah I'm ready right the fast life
Getting twisted almost every night my mind is deeper
Than the voice featured on Barry White I'm not the marry type
I make her sit in vinegar to get the candy tight
I'm flattered at all the chatter and comparisons
To the great soon to see me right on Madison
Bally sneakers trying to stay up out the vat of sins
I tout the tacky shit I'm like a wild Iraqi
Outdoors with my sport vest leather on the shoulder
Hold the rifle in place knife in your face
I'm out the world just like a lightning in space
The ice sculptures on the table going nice with the plates of grapes

This is madness certified madness
Rapping like a bandit serving my advantage
Singlehandedly slam you to the canvas
Marijuana leaves are getting wrapped just like a bandage

Fuck the love I want the money and the pussy
Brazilian bitches names tatted on their tushie
You're a man dressed as a woman call him Tootsie
I'm in the corner with a hooker playing footsie
Phone in my hands at all times like I'm a pimp fuck shrimp
We eat steak wine and cheese plate
Bronsonline the name is ringing out in each state
Play it cool or taste the weapon time to meet fate
My feet slide just like a hockey player
Eating yakitori getting hammered in the sake lair
She Sucks happy ending shower
Wifey making dinner I'll be home about an hour
Crush the sour dutches from the Netherlands
My rolling skills is undefeated yo you'll never win
I bring the devil in Bronson known for his benevolence
Polo fitted with a leather grip

I wash my dick in the sink right when I wake up
Twisted from the night before raw inside a frightening whore
Hop in the whip and go for breakfast
Fried eggs and prime steak that's straight from out of Texas
Damn I'm living reckless smoking all day just like the brisket
My beard is golden brown just like a biscuit
Everyday I'm thinking should I risk it add another number to statistics
Or use the breast milk to eat my Crispix
I'll feed her coke for a dick suck
Put a fucking roman candle up in this bitch butt
Now it's on the computer got the pussy moister than Bermuda
Pop a hole right through her throat that's no joke 'cause I'mma shoot her

Yo three verses ain't enough anymore these days man Fuck

This shit is rawer than a tuna on a plate for eighty dollars
Or the sex that I be having though I hate my baby momma
It's always drama she got too much time on her hands
Watching Tyra steady planning a plot on your man
My eyes are open like an owl though
Animosity trying to get the paper sour dough
But if I die before the hour go
Just place the Ballys on my feet and smoke my body like a pharaoh ho
Egyptian fixtures patties by the colliseum
Guns from Russia I turn 'em to a ballerina
Cop the work then they bagging coke
Transporting interstate Carolina to Tobacco Road
To the knee or to the ankle where the jacket go
Master flow work now so I got cash to blow
When I'm older leather on a rugby shoulder
I'm top dogging if I'm lying may they slump me over

Thirty thousand for the DNA swab don't quit your day job
You batty boys ain't even on my radar
Order breasts of veal at Walt Frazier's
Dog my women come in all flavors fold paper Lord save us
Complete a drug deal in a rental rented from AVIS
Best believe my motherfucking Timberlands pounding the pavement
Dog I lay with hoes I smoke butter the same color as Jalen Rose
Stand on the balcony naked just screaming Fuck it I made it
Every meal I eat steak to make a statement
Patrick Bateman thirty Mexicans in the basement let's get it shaking
The whole block's smelling like bacon
My shorty keep it real take a shit out the car window
Hide money in a Nintendo
Got a degree in dental
Cook like she down in the delta
Wrestled the gator for the foot display
River monsters Dog the Bounty Hunter
Open bally stuntin' this is Southern Califronia summer bitch

It be the novelist bare-handed choke a hippopotamus
I need to go to Drug-Dealing Anonymous
Cheerio ship-flip like Rey Mysterio
Me laid up with big money be the scenario
Out the watch flew a canary it's cuckoo
Let my man who just came home throw a party where you poo-poo
Uh that is not a nice thought
Get locked up in the afternoon I make it out by Night Court
Long as I don't see that world
I got the lawyer on retainer like a teenage girl
Eating chicken parmesean in the holding cell
My feet up hittin' my G-Pen yeah you know me well
Quadruple-black coupe smacks for if you act stupid
No love here motherfuckers I clap Cupid jump in the black Buick
Then make a sharp right
My mother wrist is so cut look like a shark bite
And when I play the guitar I'm always on acid
She said I look like David Justice when she see me floating in the Maxima
It's me
Peel the top off the can of Pellegrino
Lost my money at the tables but I got it back in Cee-lo
I'm trying to have the bank account with all the Zero's
Rolling Camaros Jose Canseco was my hero
Swing the bat like I swing the 'Lac
Snap my fingers and they bring the crab
Wave my hand and they bring the bag
For your body motherfucker 'cause you old news
And then you see me fucking skip away in boat shoes
Fucko amethyst on the knuckle
On the arm something Spanish with a bubble

Uh it's big trouble in Little China
All of the china hidden inside of a big vergina
Uh I'll pile drive her through the bed
Hit the strip get my motherfucking bread don't you say a word bitch
I need the gators just to match the vest
Have my apprentice put the stainless to a bastard's chest
Come out the sweatsuit
Do a triple back flip into the red coupe

Comehold my dick while I take a piss
Shake it off put it back in my boxer shorts
Ride in the drop top lobster Porsche
Inside the joint I got some pasta sauce
Uh stalking the street just to put the fork in the beef
Coffins are cheap seats are very soft in the Jeep
The lights hit me at the club my skin was like a chicken
And now my leather to the ankle by my Pippen
This feels crazy and I hoping I don't blow it
That goes to show I'm still a human under all this glow
Needless to say I'm exceeding while you pussies bleeding
I guess your weight was not in season
It's always me yeah uh
Yeah beautiful magnifique straight up ah-ha

No time for struggle 'cause we shining today
Look out the window see me flying away

It's a proven fact money make the world go round
And a couple sweet words'll make your girl go down
On the whole team 'cause you weren't taking care of business
See me in a Bimmer see you in a Civic uh

No time for struggle 'cause we shining today
Look out the window see me flying away

When I step up in the party yes I'm letting my nuts hang
Tryna fuck a groupie bitch right on the hood of the Mustang
From a place where they bust things hailing from Flushing
Peace to Bloodstain Beamer custame
On a California king where the thug lay 
The joint longer than Mutombo finger my features etch
Shorty sniffin' lines like a sketch
Tell her that I need my slippers fetched
I need a wifey tongue longer than Kakey
Shoot the gun right when I whistle plus she never will snake me
Do a split on my dick
If I'm sick she'll even clean me if I shit in my pants
So I'm taking her to France with me

Doing math like an Asian student
I've been a truant three language fluent
Blueish on the Buick
Reddish on the hue of the cheeks on my booby
Her body smoking like a dooby
The joint rolled like a croissant mad butter
Golden brown
If I end up in the can then who gon' hold me down 
Probably no one
They like it when you hot when you not
They tell you eat a cock off the springboard I dive into the drop
Gold watch like I just retired
No socks in the loafer 'cause it's tacky
At least I'm not up in Pataki's
You catch me higher than a Shaq knee
See me swerving side to side like Mutombo finger
The bundle bringer guns are subtle
Hear them clapping like the end of the huddle
I might be big as a bear but nothing to cuddle
Hop in the shuttle land in Russia

It's a proven fact money make the world go round
And a couple sweet words'll make your girl go down
On the whole team 'cause you weren't taking care of business
See me in a Bimmer see you in a Civic uh

Guy Oh man would you tell these motherfuckers what it is please 
I gotta tell them what it is
Guy Yeah I'm asking you to do me that favor
Wilding the street that's what I'm about

I've been locked up with the most wildest fucking dopeheads wild enough they don't even know they do dope

Anywhere I go you know you're goin' with me
Bobby and Whitney without the sniffin'
Dog your bitch look like Eddie Griffin
I'm three wheelin' keep the Chevy tippin'
Big bearded Buddha bangin' bitches in Bermuda
Barry Bonds barracuda Chattanooga
Back alley shooter black Balley booter
Catch me jumpin' out the plane like a black puma
Stoned pump Depeche Mode
Man all I see is red snow
Left my man with a headstone on Edgecombe
He was goin' for the glory in the end zone
Am I gonna sell my soul That depends ho
Man the vehicle's a rental speak gentle
Stab your father while he's pissin' in the men's room

Just can't seem to get you off of my mind
All that seems we're goin' nowhere
Only in America
And I just can't seem to get you off my mind
The best things in life are free
All that seems we're goin' nowhere

New-York city what the fuck is goin' on
These mothafuckas won't play my song
They sayin' that we soft they sayin' that we fell off
They sayin' that these other fuckers better than us you gotta be kiddin'
A bunch of pussies when you piss you gotta be sittin'
You tie your hair in a bun and shirt in a knot
You got the urge to suck the cock of Serge Ibaka
Pictures of naked rappers hangin' in your locker
You and your father never played catch he taught you how to twerk
Since I've been on the Earth I've been lightin' up
And I've been all around the world twistin' dykes and purp
Shit light the earth

The best things in life are free

Orlando Magic warm-up suits and black Shaqs
Ninety-five younger Bronson on the fast track
To blast gat now I'm looking past that
I want the cash stack higher than the NASDAQ
I put the work in the downtime I'm cooking lamb
A thousand Dutches in the air like it's a reefer jam
Or risk the forest where the motherfucking rest your team be
Peking duck and large liver goose carver
Swiss Bally's smoke cigar just like a new father
You know the motto jacket to the knee
I can't help if I'm a fiend I had to tap into the beat Lord
Spark a seance 'cause everybody lifted
I'm like the strainer with the fucking powder being sifted up
This is Queens Day alleys where the fiends play
Yo cuff the Guess on the construction take it easy

This for my people making sales until they back hurt
See the beast on the creep they let the Mac squirt
Bitch on the backs that do the dippies on the bikes and
Loud pipes and rocking leathers like a wild Viking
My man who just came home and some are going up
Fiends up in the alley sippin Balley fucking throwing up
Keep your mind straight focus on the prize
Always diving into thighs blowing smoke into the skies

Bronsonelli the problem we got the party reeking
Never see us starving all my people hardly speaking
When it's time though we form into a single file
Spray the fucking ballcourt without hitting a single child
Hop in the Beamer Pigeon popping the nina
Getting top in a steamer scoping rock in a Tina
Hooker that type of looker eat the pussy from the back
Take the children to the school baking cookies serving packs all day
Know the verbal is Oscar-winning
You cop a squat to piss in only focused on them rocks that glisten
Suppositories in the ass of you the green Fila with a Horsey how this motherfucking bastard do
Bet the crib that you ain't fucking with this grown man
I'll E. Honda a thousand slap you with the whole hand
Sex a dime herbally a blessed time
Check the rhyme motherfucker better recognize

The eyes slanted from the origami I roll a quarter of the water
Near the border where you oughta find me
The Tamborine Man pumping while the Tyson burning
Air Tech Challenge clay court checks balance
Stay endorsing that weak shit my team spit
That mean shit like stepping in some fiend's shit
Now you sick to your stomach because you stunted
Word got fronted another motherfucking jerk confronted
Post pattern Lonnie threw the loaf at 'em
Flushing motherfucker keep a toast up by the gold Saturn
Little doulas on the block we tell 'em go stab 'em
Relieve him of his shoes it's easier to toe tag 'em'
Carhartt sets and Horseys like the Preakness
Bronson love a freak bitch dining on that Greek dish
Cash inside the case and now the judges want to play ball
Since the last time I seen you boo I been around the world
Drugs is gettin' twirled while driving something absurd
Something you never seen gold and forest green
Leanin' growl like a demon the tires smoking when I'm leaving
Playing poker on the river boat
Hid the ace long rifle in my bitch's coat
Flip off the balcony knife to the throat ice in the coke
Coke on the table wild n' out in Roanoke
They had the freshwater bass served five styles
Flix with Ellen DeGeneres rockin' Perry Ellis
Been a degenerate cutting ribbons with senators
Knock on my door with balloons and that big check
I'm not surprised though still dippin the five-0
It's all about survival me and Supplies man alive on arrival

I got the drugs rolled perfect
The gold turkish Flow furnished
I been a earner just call me earnest
Leave the logistics to attorneys but if its money it concerns me
Yo wake the fuck up tell my bitch to pull the truck up
Had the marijuana rolled up bitch this shouldn't be a hold up
So much paper it don't fold up grab the plastic it won't mold up
I'm on the boat smoking gold dust
I marry ya niece cash me out in Paris for fleece
Shoot the back of ya knees Gary Sinise
Speaking Arabic in Greece
Grown men turn the keys to cheese as I water ski Belize

I seen a lot but I ain't seen it all
Dreams to ball but I ain't talking bout Seton Hall
Hot red Lamborghini special seat and all
Plus the doors open up like a season whore
Now you motherfuckers are sour wishin' you had the vision
Could've been doing division stay in the coupe like a pigeon
Apartment is getting close to the roof ya boy is risen
Greek men jump off the back of the boat for dinner
Barehanded snatch up a octopus I'm a winner
Grill it hit it with olive oil and lemon
Then kiss my fingers efharisto that was delicious
Catch me on Venice Beach working on my base no blonde streak
Swimming trunk thirty grands in arm's reach
I'm on the boat in the water like a swan's feet
To show respect you kiss both sides of the Don's cheek
Call my homie tell him meet me down in Lido Beach for lunch
Placido Polanco crib his bitch was black
She started purring I kissed the cat
Aristocrat wrist dancing like a disco bass
In the holster same shit color as Sisqo's hair
Cheat off a Chinese kid just like a school test
I'm on the hunt for loot jump out the chunky coupe
Hold on wait till it thunder here's the gun to shoot
Beige leather to the calf where my math at 
You gonna babysit my joint Then pussy pass that

I'm getting paper regardless I'm never facing no charges
I got your honor under the armpit
The gavel slam and I walk
Hammer dances on the porch downtown gallivanting with a horse
Two different drugs to choose I need the third thing
Oriental style shirt
Flapping in the wind like a bird's wing
I need that good green ugh motherfucker need that good green

I got the face like a grown lion my people hold iron
Predict the weather by the wind like an old Mayan
Hold my son up show him to the kingdom
While all his blood brothers became drug runners in England
Made in Queens Handball courts and forties
Shorties smoking blunts spades in the corner
We moving white like David Spade in the sauna
All the money chronological it look like callaloo
Provide the crew designer suits exotic food
Erotic nude and polished shoes impala smooth
Roll up looking like Sinbad with the earring
Lightskin sucking my penis while I'm steering
Fuckin' standin' like the Notre Dame logo right now
Just leave this shit man

If I choose the right horse 
Never take the night off 
Ever since I came out 
Fold a wire hanger through your nose take your brain out
Hey now on the stage I'm like great balls of fire 
One more year I'll be on Lake George retired 
Big steak like a Jeep tire 
Season up some biceps and throw 'em in the deep fryer

I'm sick like feedin' squirrels the summer in a bubble jacket
If this was ninety-six I def' had The Tunnel packed in
Big beard like I'm lumberjackin' 
Mash the pedal of the eight fifty sound like the thunder crackin'
I'm in a club with a condom on 

Microphone attached to my head so I can dance my little heart out
Don't make me bring the white guitar out
Like the one in Wayne's World that was shinin' in the window
Since thirteen I been a nympho uhh
Fuck That's Delicious on box set
Me and my mans smokin' on big drugs and feasting on the ox leg
Stand in the store with twenty Ahmed's 
Bazookas on shoulders hundred pounds of C4 in a stroller
I just dropped a million kroner I'm a stoner
You lack culture I'm a psychedelic image of a black vulture
Trapped inside a past soldier uhh 

I just blew my motherfuckin' high man 
I been high since I was this big motherfucker

And when I die make sure you spread my blood on a BMW
Albanian style I wanna die by machine gun
 
I mean man I made million off molasses yesterday
I'm only rhymin 'cause I'm nice
I don't even give a shit no more

Look at the game say bitch I deserve you
Here forever that's my word boo
I know my words slurring now but when I sober up
I just called to see how the fuck you've been holding up

I know you heard your boy's been hopping out the Rover truck
Long remove from when I rode the bus
Now I'm diving up in Polish sluts
With the gorgeous butts
And she love it when I throw her in the Cobra clutch
Window half down
Smoke trickle out
Stripper vixen out the blouse
Put the pickle in the pouch
No more sushi style reserved for the past days
Big joints filled with hash in my ashtrays
We still fam' though we chose different pathways
I heard you're sniffing
Cleaning plates like the Cascade
Death's the only thing that's certain
Once was the cash fades
Fuck it I'm getting money til my last days

Your number changed and I ain't recognized the ringtone
So pardon for the unannounced
The rain you know I've been gone
Flip the fucking beat up
I was looped around the planet
In the coupe with the cannon
With the car and the camera
Paparazzi never flashed
The days are way beyond us
Fact they never flash and I'm below the surface honest
Never blast my way out
I stroll out pull by
Under the nose of anybody that knows not
Check-in's out of courtesy 'cause these are not requirements
Wait until our time is up iron and the niacin
Boomer Esiason flying out the Lion's den
This is weird science inside a siren's blend
I hit the solid ten water just a little splashing
Loop it up and bring it back man 'cause this is Action

With the team money be the dream
I take it multicolor baby it ain't gotta be green
On the other side of earth with the queen I'm from Queens
Shit 3 different types of forks for a Monday lunch
Tamarind punch higher than a javelin jump
Italian sluts my whole battalion is nuts
We rock medallions and such
Don't even step within six feet of my presence
Leave you open like the desert Def Leopard Fresh pepper
Did I mention steer the whip with one arm like Jim Abbott
Chocolate sauce over thin rabbit
If these opportunities arose before we would've been had it
Shorty sniffing haddock in the attic
I been an addict in these streets in my pants I've even shatted
Then sat in it sadly
Two things about to cop a few rings
And eat paper thin slices of the Blue Ling
Shoot eagles on a Jack Nicklaus course Porsche with the triple exhaust
Seats soft like a midget's cough

I never thought that this could be my life
Russian mistress and Parisian wife
Always seasoned rice the animals you find in the jungle on the table sculpted in ice
Throw the dice
Leg drop after a big boot
Dive out the chopper in the water uh
No splash Olympic shit
Ayo the spliff look like a shrimp when it shit
Smoke the shark Greg Norman shit me and Robert Horry in a foreign whip
Motherfucka I was born to live
And born to fuck a lot of pussy without spawning kids
You said that I was worthless
Sure enough the toxins came up to the surface
I'll take your oxygen I'm perfect
Better bring your iron to the skirmish
Step on heads of serpents smoke detergent
Robert Downey Jr. rotate image
Old money in the bag look like sauteed spinach bitch
Manicurin' like a China spin out the beamer at the arena
Bitches spot me like a cheetah
Wild life wild nights with your wife 
Now who the one that be turnin' the wheel in the old Deville
Step in the field suckas know I'm real
Long sword down the leg so I stand still
Red beard so I resemble Jim the Anvil
Neidhart ride dirty in the five sharp
Hand skills Jean Claude fine art
Put my head right through the Monet ole
All the drugs I smoke my lungs are probably coal gray
Ice on the Rolly dykes on the pole play
Gravitatin' towards the money 'cause it brings me joy
Only thing next to my baby girl and baby boy
Drop Mercedes toy
With your moms butt naked cookin' eggs like Ving Rhames in Baby Boy
You know the outcome you ain't about none
Smoke 'til my mouth numb
Hold the chopsticks at the top you know I'm upper class
Grab the sizzle beef with my teeth
Hop in the vehicle lit the keef
Back in the streets it's me

Smokin' blueberry like a muffin
Yo I'm the one your lady lovin'
Just tell that bitch I need a scrubbin'
And don't forget the chicken in the oven
Never burn a dinner spend cake on cheese
Red mirror lenses in the gray Oakleys
Flip out the plane with a cape on skis
Girl I really love it when you're dancin' on me
Dancin' on me dancin' dancin' on me
No time flat I'm gonna be on TV
With a big batty gal skin tropical
I'm doin' all the things you never seen possible
Daddy did the three-piece and mommy brought the cloak out
Nowadays you can catch me out in So Cal
Spendin' five stacks in a week in the grow house
Now I'm highed up makin' popcorn
Flip the bag this side up
Then sit back on the couch
And let me put my penis in your mouth
'Cause girl I really want some head tonight
You can find us in the garden like Spike on any night
Encrusted in some ice that look bluish in the light
Spanish on the mistress Jewish on the wife
Shootin' like a Piston aim for proper distance
Live from London number crunchin'
Drivin' gloves with some Asian bitches rubbin' me with sponges
Expensive lunches wages off of hunches
I bet the dogs and if I win it then the paper yours
Pack your bag wash your pussy then leave
Meet me at the airport the plane is leaving at 3
She said alright blew smoke through my nose
It's the talented younger stallion no Pinocchio nose

Please stop your shit's all hype dude
Meanwhile the wrist all spiteful
Just be real that shit's not like you
Man you know these things go through a cycle
Straight from Queens rock fatigue all weather
Fila three-quarter cream feet all leather
Never sing the blues man my team mo' better
We blow cheddar au four feta
City lights shine bright on my complexion
Self-reflection red hands flashing at the intersection
Life is green-lit one star no script
Supporting actors fresh peaches no pit
I love my people considered as my brothers
Came from different mothers came up in the same struggle
Some estranged some deep up in the game still
Money separate believe you know the fame will

Ayo macerate the fruit tap it over angel's food
Yeah we gettin' loot Timberland the boot
Kush is by prescription prolific in the kitchen
People on my dick because I'm vicious with the diction
House shoes and some khakis on the west
Hit the beach up twist the Cheech up let the beat thump
Never fuckin' with the crab that's pre-lumped
Makin' bitches sign a pre-nup
Chocolate with the mean rump
Serve some cream stuff shit to make the fiends jump
Crispy greenery tropical the scenery
Believe you me this shit ain't always what it seem to be
I'm feastin' dolo down in Eataly
I'm in the street like a hooker's feet
I'm known to sit on leather
I'm smokin' hash and marijuana 'cause it go together
Three in the morning we on the corner rockin' Polo sweater

It might be the illest track I ever wrote
I'm sippin' something I gotta sip before I rap
Medication in the plastic bag
I'm a man motherfucker you're a half a fag
My chest is hairy like the Cubans rocking silk
In the eighties on Miami beach
You're just a rabbit that be captured by the falcons feet
I hunt for the meat see me we can thump in the street
Fuck around leave you slumped in your seat
'Cause we're coming from Queens every platter is Zagat rated
Caramelized up bulls are getting castrated
Hold up hold up someone pass the weed to me
Fuck a routine I'm switching up the scenery
Boats with decks strictly using throats for sex
Yoga stretch open pussy like a sofa bed
Key lime spear fishing off the Yucatan
Grab a barracuda higher than a parachuter
Pair of shooters Anthony and Harper
Caciocavalli dog I'm sharper than the archer
I'm an artisan down for bi-partisan
'Cause everyone getting paid see me with the freshest fade
Charles Oakley gecko belts and durangos
I fuck good and make big seeds like a mango
NFL ready sculpted for the clay court
Simple spaghetti shifting in the gray sport
Suck my dick bitch real good
Mother fuck a kid Action Bronsolino suck my balls

No disrespect ma I'm tryna eat the pussy
Lift your legs over you head so I can taste the tushy
King Thrust is what they call me at the hooker house
Hundreds pounds of pressure right in a hookers mouth
Put it in from behind its the salad I toss
She ride me like a maniac
Best believe the bitch a brainiac
She known to keep a fresh shaven cat
Milk chocolate and her eyes like the sun
Keep a loaded twenty-two inside her thighs and her buns
Her pussy lips are tight just like the box of a nun
She'll have a fiend itchy and scratchy for rock in the slums
Boosting in the boostiere
I give my favorite Goose away just to get a closer look at how the juices spray
Fucking tired can't go no more
My raps are marinated days ahead
Jalapeno cream cheese on the raisin bread
That's for breakfast
I've got a death wish you never catch Bronsolino in a necklace
I'm on the block like tetris
Caddy green Northstar engine

Muthafucka you knocked my teeth out 
Hey Sticks come on 
Big willy I'm fuckin' whores
Since a youngin' grabbed the pistol skipped the chores
Hit the weed and said It's on
Got with my older Loc's they threw your boy a zone
Before my mom could smell the scent that shit was gone
Movin' on to bigger things now don't call my phone
Carry chrome I think them boys after me
But I shoot fast like athletes
Number one Magic flipper I'm Anfernee
Oops threw a couple at your coupe
Mr. Hard-top don't fuckin' lose your roof
Empty most of the clip shit only got one sin
Where's Waldo at Put this bitch to his lens
Got the dimes all wrapped on his block like you're still friends
Still low from the po-po no L's in the Volvo

Caught a statuatory rape 'cause the steak wasn't mature
I'm laid out by the lake you lay with inflatable mates
I lace my shoes tight and ready for the paper chase
I like my girls with African bodies and Asian face
Only pink pills placed in my dressing room
Pineapple juice roast turkey
If I want I got a bitch to suck a thirty dick circle
Then hop up in a cab this just to serve a bitch purple
Come back make rice for the fellas
Every single person rockin' leather
Cheddar attatched my mental is hatched from the medicine cabinet
Rock a shirt got the pattern of the wilderness habitat
I make kids NFL ready
Yours are twenty-three wearin' bibs slurping spaghetti
Your family cancer took her tits off
Don't even look us in the eye
Spit the shit to make a lesbian cry dyke
See me wiggle the Porsche keys
Grapes crackers gorgeous cheese
Shifting gears left handed at mighty morphin' speeds
She suck me off while I torch the weed
She throw the drug in her butt
She hasn't shit for days
She chill with dykes from the state right where the Mystic play
You got a nice white dick
That's what the sistas say
Hit the switch then I switch the lane
Dipped 66 in grey
Lines laying on my shoulder
Olive green loafs covering my toes up
Loud cover my clothes with that five wagon coke
I'm doper than a salsa singer's nose
Smoke somethin'

Cinderella Ballerina import important passports
Money cools the heart but can't be too rude
Mind frame and attitude of a young Uncle Scrooge
You roody poo's get abused
Hulk Hogan
Ultimate Warrior
The eggs get boiled
Clash of the Titans
Conan the Destroyer
Turn tables with the young Clark Gable
Different mind fables
Syrup pours like maple
I'm watching cable
Plus my building marble housing structure
Prescription deductible

That Ultramagnetic
Rhyme force like a lama spit
Electrifying
Just like a Blanka hit
They duckin' like the Gaza strip
No worries got it covered like Islamic chicks
I promise to body every beat
The hunger is bottomless
So peep game
But they fronted so you know that we can't follow it
It gets deep and you can tell the way
That she swallows dick
My brain is a lethal weapon
Tongue projects them hollow tips
The vision so vivid
Feeling like you might've lived it
But you didn't
You bit it the minute that we delivered it
Just admit it get the Medikit
Break it into two like subject and predicate
Coppa for president
Yeah good hoodie shorty got the good pussy
Sniff coke off a crisp hundred
Stay blunted silk pants sip France
Chicks dance I stand in the pimp stance
West coast laid back feel the breeze
Burnin' trees in diplomas earn degrees
In the winter mockneck circle ski
Wanna party pop that purpley
Oh shit happens in the building
Scrape the women hide the children
Give a bitch rimshot like a Zildjian
Me and Mildred eating like a pilgrim
Huh yo Tommy Lasorda
Dodge bullets dive into the water
True lies diamonds at the porter
Shoot like Terry Porter pimpin' with your Asian daughter
I'm always ready for a minor bid
Not for long 'cause I need me some vagina kid
Tryna catch strange soup in the silk
Well-built with the coupe in the kilt
I need some mouth from a woman
I couldn't get it so I took it though I shouldn't
Sick shit like Ferrara with the footage
Stick shift in Ferrari oh my goodness
Hood bitch sweatpants good tits
Big bitch make me want to tackle her
Fuck around Urlacher her
Enough of that I'mma shoot dice abusin' the wall
'Til I cruise on the shore barbecues on the four
Mad drugs on the table and I'm doing 'em all
And I'm never gon' fall
Last time we locked eyes slapped hands with the kid
Now you rambling kid you should have handled that shit
When you see me motherfucker better handle your biz
Better handle your biz

Put the flame to his sneakers I'm a pyro
Barrel revolutions got us spinning like a gyro
The suitcase is filled with filo
Here's a side-note
Fuck around leave you on the side road
Five stars on the dinner plate
Pardon 'em see me studded like Cardamom
Play your part 'cause you don't really want no part of 'em
Take the key out the ignition shouldn't have started 'em
Joints twisted like a sprained foot
Red beard big blue eyes a strange look
It's like I'm chopping down trees
Jump out the chopper on skis maltese
I'm stunned by the mountains and the sunrise
Stash work in the mattress where your son lies
Enter the casket under dirt and the guns cry
I'm going out blazing squeezing at the one time

You ain't a boss you just playin' boss
Pop him in his head pray on his corpse
Knee on his neck and his sternum
Askin' for forgiveness when I'm done I'mma burn him
You dancin' with the demons
I know you see the European leanin'
And the chain and watch gleamin'
And you thinkin' this a dreamin'
Welcome to the nightmare
Blunts the Delorean
This shit'll travel light-years
But you gon' end up right here
My rap style is impeccable
Standing still in the mirror but seein' my reflection move
Phantom no vehicle ghost no vehicle
A Ouija board it ain't weed what the fuck I need it for
And what the fuck you got me heated for
Real cool nigga show you what the heat is for
Ghost and Bronson shoot like Bronson
Cook you like Swanson now look at your conscience
All I want to do is buy boots ride coupe hide loot
Uh flick chives in the soup
Stick knives where you poop
Backflips off the ledge hang-glide off the roof
Land on one leg see me all up on the front page
Holding a pump gauge ready to dump aim
At your nuts like the mouth of a whore
Somersault Cadillac on the door
I been gorgeous good friends with the florist
Transportin' work in the Sequoia
Now the chandeliers inside the foyer feet wrapped in snake
The rug gotta hibernate jacket tryna find a mate 
Choke a duck lay it on the plate 
Snap my fingers for the waiter come and pour the grapes 
What's the word baby  
Only vision out my home window 

Suede kicks shootin' ball at the park 
Thousand on the free throw you just a Webelow
I'm a full-grown human half my leg covered in Ewings
You know a pussy gettin' ruined to the point where it doesn't even work
Taz and Bugs Bunny on the shirt
Hop up in the Jag and skirt
While I show you how the magic work
Take a bastard lay him down in dirt
Aim at your apple with the archery
Chef with the tweezers place the parsley for me
Person in the travel car seat's a G
I'm gettin' V while you home beatin' meat
Can I sense I'm a stud
Drink the blood of the snake
Burn a fake at the stake
Drinkin' grapes with the steak
Make a cake for your wake
Jamaican dancers on your face rockin' 8's

To the back with the hat lean back in the 'llac
Crack the window hear the soldier styles and that in back
Ain't no Cat in the Hat just a cat that can rap
This is Bronson representing Flushing Queens on the map
Heavyweight primate with a Harvard mind
Blunts filled with the citrus mixed with orange lime
Pussy drip when the thought of Action come to mind
Born to ride winter spring summer shine
Bonafide eyes wide run and hide
You don't want the revolution to be televised
Terrorfied from the Arab mountain death camps
With the iron burning hot give you chest stamps
Phone calls with the cloth over the mouthpiece
With or without leaf burn about an ounce chief
To the neck like a razor for the stubble
Raised inside the struggle blazin in the huddle yeah
Dig a hole throw the lamb in it
Left the slippers in the sand motherfuckers couldn't stand in it
It's Barry Horowitz rap I pat myself on the back
Don't fake the funk on a nasty dunk Shaq I attack
Close the window to your soul weed inside my lungs burn
These old suckers gettin placed into a young urn
Specialized like the little bus
Use my chubby little finger first to stimulate the clitoris
King Kong ain't got shit on us
I'm out here gettin it for real while you motherfuckers filibust'
Weed in my finger flicker I'm on a solo mission
Started at pole position eyes on the long division
As it burn my thumb I roll another one
Quite persistant that's why they call me my mother's son
Shoot the cold gift leave your ho stiff
Make your ho sniff Hootie and the Blowfish
Obey the coke king
'Cause every motherfucker in rockin loaded I'm on that old shit

Five minute beats one take raps
No false stories of my gunplay stats
Drugs sit beside me blunts stay fat
Hand-craft the music rhymes stay acoustic
Pies and Thighs on my mind all the time roll the lime
Fuck rap I was class with my bus pass
Early nineties Tom Selleck with the moustache
Your eyes are blind to the diamond in the rough
Needle in the hay charismatic character far from amateur
Spider senses so I'm scanning the parameter
Straight from scrubs so my uncle is a janitor
Love my Mother hate a motherfucker hate a piece of shit hate a cocksucker
Stand beside me motherfucker you're my brother
Came from different pussies but we share the same supper

Five minute beats one take raps
No false stories of my gunplay stats
Drugs sit beside me blunts stay fat
Blunts stay fat blunts stay fat

West Palm Beach betting on a dog race
Bitch with me big titties and a small waist
Pistol noise shiftin' in a Hitler toy
Kick shit young Ruud van Nistelrooy
Eating brisket chilling at the bris
Knuckles like I punch walls metal in the fist
Smoking seven kinds of pepper and shit
Veteran shit give Melissa Etheridge a dick
Stroke pussy like a cat lover
My kids are mixed that means they got a black Mother
And their Father's a G
Strictly Oolong on the tea the shirt straight from nineteen ninety-three man with the ski
Peace to lo-lives Brooklyn smart crew Queens
Sharp tooth fiends in the chartreuse jeans
Old Girbaud shit pockets in the front
Waist thirty-three odd sizes out of Marshalls

Five minute beats one take raps
No false stories of my gunplay stats
Drugs sit beside me blunts stay fat
Blunts stay fat blunts stay fat
Kid Queens shit Blue Chips shit
Yeah here I am again Big Fuckin' Body it's me
We done came a long fucking way from stealing out the supermarket man
I'm out here oh my god
We out here so fuckin' heavy man
Mr. Motherfuckin' Marvelous Himself
But enough about me man and more about myself
We out here all types of big situations on the table man
And I'm just pulling my chair up man
Let me put my motherfucking paper plates up man
I had the most fuckin' tunas in the house
Rice game soup game ridiculous man
I had all a dat man
Soap deodorant on stack
Two buckets under the bed man
You must be outchea motherfuckin' mind man
Platinum in the street
You must be out your fuckin' head
Do me a favor with that light the candle
Is that the Hawaiian Rayman 
Aight I get the same one every single time I don't understand this

At the piano with a glass of pino
All red silk like I'm nino
Custom made shit I weight one hundred forty kilos
Sneeze on my hundreds of hoes on their knees blow from Montego
The way my hair look you swear my name was Rodrigo
Lay low if you can't do it then just say no
If you ain't built to play this game then you get halo'd
I put a lot of fiends in k-holes

I'm just a bastard with a bad habit
Bad back in a black Volkswagen Rabbit
Black magic woman put a spell on me
Fuck around and win a spelling bee
I could walk under ladders still win the lotto
Ten minutes flat built a boat in a bottle
Roy Rogers bathroom sniffin' coke with a model
Told her to Google me shit I might paint the Cougar green
All this lechuga in my jeans
I still see Freddy Kruger in my dreams
Ain't nothin' moving but the cream
Shit know I do it for team

I just wanna hear em announce your name that's all I care about
My knee is  It's not bad these past few days

That's all I care about
Took a meeting up at Paramount
Typecast as a romantic lead
I'm classically trained for drug dealing
But I wasn't good at drug dealing
So I flipped shit rug ceiling
Or got 5 quarters for the store

Fuck knows what I'm saying anymore mane my mind is shot been working so motherfuckin' hard
So I'm bout to light this motherfuckin' dab up
Til the next time peace

This my mothafuckin' game man
I don't give a fuck what nobody says no more
No more playing the sidelines 

Albanian style rock leathers in the sand
I'll shoot my cousin for nothing dominant man
Go visit fam with no problems on some normal shit
Straight from Skopje Macedonia the floral lit
Licorice liquor one cube a touch of water
Watch it mix turn white like the Duchess' daughter
I'm in the corner puffing Ganja with the musky odor
Destination back of your throat cup of soda
This is Bigelow Queens to Asbury Park connect Figaro
My uniform Carhartt sweats and Gore-tex athletic horses on my chest and on my short sets
The Leslie Nielsen of the weed and the words
Naked gun the serial is scratched off
Armed like Rocket in his prime blast off

Push your seat back The Rickey Henderson of rap
Jets hat underneath a little blubber lie the 6 pack
Summer time I cop the musket with the kick back
Then sit back stand up eyes low hit that
This happens continuously throughout the night
Now my eyes are like diamonds that's looking blue-ish in the light
Like a prism shooting out hope honor and optimism
Never stop it till we're coastal on the aqua mission
Reach my hand in the water and grab a tuna
Silhouette you see reflection of light right off the Mezzaluna
That's a half moon wavy like my man's fade
The European carry-all
Color tan suede
Handmade hand blades carve up your features I'm a creature
Fiends get washed up like turtles on the beaches
It's mating season make the verbal for your speakers

Marijuana like the pussy I keep it crudo
That's raw now I declare war
You in the women's league
I show you how a man score
Look at my beard and my body like a grizzly
I'm shoulder pressing 3 plates
Still drinking vintage out the bottle with the cheese plate
The Derek Harper with the low Caesar flow fever
More than likely digging in your ho's beaver
Drug smoke to my neck just like a turkey
Dough dirty make your brother do a curtsy no mercy Van Buren cop Hershey
Square Tyson and I'm in the mountains eating rare bison
Clam chowder you ain't fucking with this man-power
Straight from Queens where we're known to make your plans sour

On and on push it through we won
Never stop till the day we there
I smoke drugs as if it's cigarettes Popping like a giga pet
See my silhouette right behind me bitches pirouette
That's a dance move it's origin is French
I'm chilling in the park with several warrants on the bench
Suspended license Over four years that's three cars after
'Cause I'm like a mush everything is a disaster
Put 'em in the bathroom 'cause that'll be the answer
Let 'em know I'm sick and every flow is like a cancer
Catch a rooster cut his fucking nuts off
Serve 'em for a hundred dollars sesame and plum sauce
Try to dip the bill the Mexicans'll let the guns off
Or cut you with a pleasure similar to getting nuts off
Your whore told me that your putz soft
Plus she caught you in the basement with a tranny getting sucked off
Wheres your morals Your genitals are floral
Like it in the back just like a fucking epidural
Me I'm like a caveman raised from out the mountains
Oriental bathhouses laying on the couches
Cop a rub-and-tug until I'm spraying like a fountain
Take a hundred out my pocket lay it on the counter
Peace arrivederci bouncing towards the exit
Asian lady crying because I left her fucking legs split
Dookie blunt of regs 'til I'm pookie in the face
Queens the kid's a star like a Mookie on the base
The flows water like rafting on the Congo
Take a hit of drugs and I'm passing like I'm Rondo
Motherfuckers sweeter than when Omar kisses 'Naldo
Get it straight sick so I simmer up the caldo de pollo
Look in my eyes you know I'm royal
Hustle up some money like Sidney and Billy Hoyle
Puerto Rican shorty features like she's Rosie
Titties like a motherfucking pocket full of posies

Obama copped me the sandwich I dipped the cops like I'm Sanders
For minor work get your momma murked napkin covered designer shirts
'Cause we eating like some animals to say the least
Bronsolin' bust a nut right in your favorite niece
Smoke in my lungs when I'm driving on the fast lane
Steering with my knees and I'm rolling almost wrecked the car
Squatting twelve plates all I do is set the bar
Call your father your a doula coulda stacked the bar
Making dough baking bread just like the French
Hustle until we're living right sleeping on the benches
Swinging for the fences helicopter chauffeur
Cyclops catch you with the lasers and the lenses
Arnold Palmer on the graphic in the beverage
Everything I do myself I'm using that for leverage
About to rape the game 'til this motherfucker hemorrhage
Moat around the crib and garages full of Benzes

I'm like a young Bill Kazmaier swollen from the juice
Primobolan in my hemoglobin chiefin' on the spruce
Rocking all white silk shorts just stop at the knee
Stay saucy like a pasta with the broccoli who's stopping me 
You gotta be out of your mind I'm an anomaly
Salt and pepper beard distinguished look just like I'm Connery
Escape the rocks see me rollin' through the furnace
If I make it to the top it's 'cause this motherfucker earned it
Well since I'm high straight polenta from the pot
On some bad lieutenant shit show me how you suck a cock
Pocket full of Mozza catch me fucking with some lesbians

I love chocolate just like Colagaro from Flushing out to Kosovo
My family pedigree picnics with Berettas
Filas on the slippers windbreaker pants and sweaters
Very clever ancient blood line gettin' cheddar
Cobblestone the streets shifting manual in Benzes
Neighbor with the hoxha him and all his shit offends
So we gather up the lamb he sacrifice it properly
Stuff and twist with cabbage leaves smoke exotically
Control the whip with one hand listen to Hendrix
Loaded magnum chrome tucked by the appendix
Every sentence like the Machu Picchu descendants
When I rhyme I'm always on time perfect attendance
I'm living splendid blowing sticky in a rented
The olive oil virgin first press it's never blended kid
I'm straight raw like Carpaccio
I'm just a heartthrob straight off the screen just like DiCaprio

Fuck your feedback respect the moustache
You're like a forty dolla holla from Guadalajara
Respect the moustache
Motherfuckers ain't promised tomorrow

Roll the drugs just like I'm Morimoto hold my nuts in my hand
That's when I pose for photo doggy I'm often dolo
'Cause I'm an only child plus I love the silence
Just me and my thoughts one hand grip the hooptie wheel
Soon you'll see me in the Coupe Deville
Eating stupid veal steady aimin' shoot to kill
Walk with a cane but no I'm not a pimp
Pinkie in the air martini glasses full of shrimp pussy

Me and my mother drivin' to the grocery store
Me ridin' shotgun with my window rolled down
She smoked cigarettes and gets what she gets by
Hustlin' harder rollers and a nightgown
Me and my father driving to the football game
Me ridin' shotgun my window rolled down
He sipped Cognac and kept us all laughin'
I was much happier when he was around
When he was around
Zen he was around

Miss lady
You could have been born a little later but I don't care
So what if your head sports a couple of grey hairs
Same here and actually I think that's funky
 
Miss lady
It looks to me like you need a little juice in your life
So call me when that big ole house gets lonelyfied
And I'll teleport from here to there
You show me how it's supposed to be done
I'll make sure you have young fun

High's the cost of living
I take what I have been given
Pastor say be strong
Ain't that much time left
I've got to funk you now

Lord be havin' mercy on my soul
I'm havin' the impression that my life gonna be a bowl of cherries
But it's very hard for me to cope
Got tired of being broke
This ATLien ain't' got no time to sit and mope
Made up my mind while ya'll made up yo beds
On a cold wooden floor is where I lay my head
Never thought I'd make it this far
Still battlin' in this racial war
Tryin' to find solutions to the situation I'm facin'
Only thing that's free is my flow that yall be chasin'
Lettin' my niggas know before I go
I drop that knowledge like dropping books
Let's stop the crooks from robbing of your brains and such
You enter my hood you won't be findin' much
Hope that when I'm gone ya'll remember this
What we stood for fuck that fame and that glitz
It's beginning to look a lot like the ending
Got to be more careful know what corners you be bendin'
Revelations getting impatient

I pray there's a god at the end of all this
Life is short take more baths
Children of the cornbread
I've never been to afrika
Sorry I forgot to call you back
Obviously oblivious
How good a friend are you
Big girls are beautiful to me
Fruit snack addict
Umm you still on yo' pyramid 
Across cultures darker people suffer most
Ok hand over the cure and stop playing
I've never had fackbook twitter or instagram
Everything is temporary

The year was 1975
That night crickets cried
They knew what was going down
Three girls travel a long country road
And one said she thinks it's time
This baby wants to come right now

I was scufflin' going to school
I was scufflin' working at night
And you know what yeah I truly believe
And that's why I tell a lot of parents
Single parents don't tell me what God can't do
I made sure you had
I never felt like you should be deprived of anything
If a man didn't want to take care of his child
You move on and that's what I did yeah I moved on

He always wanted to be a father
But he never took care of you
He ain't have no money
He ain't have nothin'
How can you care about somebody
And you never give the welfare of them
And I knew I had to go that road by myself
Its about to get bananas in here
Hey look at that ape over that baby

Now go down low don't stop now swang like orangutang
Now take it slow go on an walk now and watch him do his thing
But just don't tap the glass

Black or blue purple or yellow
The world is like a coloring book
To get the whole picture each other it took
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boojy friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
We started out so cute in our baby pictures
That mommy shot for our daddy so that he wouldn't forget you
He forgot anyway but hey one day hell remember
If not hes human Im human you human well forgive him
God gives him his ultimatum can't see how momma hates him
Hes such a cool a-s guy then wonder why she date him
Im only 8 Im not old enough guess its complicated
Two parent dwellings expelling have got so underrated
I only say this in cadence so it dont get negated
I was gon save it for later but later look like maybe
This crazy lady named Kesha is guessing my Mercedes
Would be all new and through but its the nineteen eighties
But now that we are cool she sippin Irish Baileys
She say Stacks youre true blue 
I call her Kesha she like it because its hood to her
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boojy friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boojy friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
You can't imagine the immensity of the fuck Im not giving
About your money and man servant at the mansion you live in
And I dont wanna go places where all my ladies can't get in
Just grab a bottle some boys and lets take it back to my basement
And get sleazy sick of all your lines so cheesy
Sorry daddy but Im not that easy
Im not gonna sit here while you circle jerk it and work it
Imma take it back to where my man and my girls is
Sleazy get sleazy get sleazy get sleazy 'cause imma get
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boojy friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boojy friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
I dont mean to critique on your seduction technique
But your moneys not impressing me its kinda weak
That you really think youre gonna get my rocks off
Get my top and socks off by showing me the dollars in your drop box
Me and all my friends we dont buy bottles we bring em
We take the drinks from the tables when you get up and leave em
And I dont care if you stare and you call us scummy
'Cause we ain't after your affection and sure as hell not your money honey
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boojy friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds
I dont need you and your brand new Benz
Or your boojy friends
And I dont need love looking like diamonds
Looking like diamonds

Everybody fall down sometime yeah just like that
Oh but you gotta get back to the place where they know your face
And they don't mind if you cry sometimes
They listen 'cause they cry too
I guess it ain't where you from it's where you at
It's my birthday and I'm having the best worst time of my life
A rich shade of blue

You gon' make me rich
Love is in the air
Te quiero mi quieres
Te adoro I confess
I love you do you love me 
I adore you can't you see 
Darlin' to me you are fantastic
For you I will swim the entire Panama Canal
And you will be my girl
I will dance the flamenco with a flamingo
In the streets of Miami all night long
Until you hear my song
Yes I know call me crazy
Call me insane as long as you call me

life without music's
Like life without love
Man if we had no music what would we dance to 
What would we sing to 
How would them babies learn their ABC's
And birds would have nothing to sing
Life without music This is terrible
 
We wouldn't even whistle
 
And we wouldn't have a heartbeat
'Cause we wouldn't know what a beat was
Life without music

Man we wouldn't even have no ring tones
Shawty the phone wouldn't even ring
 
It would just vibrate
At least nobody will be able to download your songs
 
She's got a point
We'll go have to do something 'bout this
I'm so cool I could be an Eskimo
Even in the summer at my house it snows
Ooh I'm always chillin' like it's forty below
I'm so hot I'm cold cool kitty
Cool kitty I'm a cool cat
Meet me at the corner of cool and ice
Where all the girls hang out you know the spots
The cars are fast and the motors are loud
If I were you I would be in the crowd 

Oh Peanut we love you baby
Do I watch cartoons 
Require something to browse it
Talk what you heard pay your penny
That means I could throwdown oh yeah and free your body
When we come to your town oh yeah
Jump up and touch the sky
Fall till you hit the dance floor oh yeah
I promise if you give it all you got
Every time they want more
Yeah more yeah more yeah
Jump up and touch the sky
Fall hit the dance floor oh yeah
I promise if you give it all you got
Every time they want more
Yeah more yeah more yeah
Ooh wait we got this thing pumpin' like
That's better than throwin' up
I'm Eddie and with my heart I love you or what
I'm Kim and I'm Kam
I'm on the turntables and I make the keyboard jam
I'm Philly Phil and I play bass
So I got that bottom bow your bottom
You know who I am I'm Tamika
And with this here guitar I'm a superstar
Hey all people I'm Madison and I'm a 
No Madison you're supposed to let them know what instrument you play
Oh um I play violin and I think we're comin' to the end bye
I would find you ninja styler

Alright Westley Funkaneers today we go to war
I want you to man your instruments
Hello Well lady your instruments whatever
You know what I'm talking about
Because we have a big problem on our hands
And I say before we let this blob take over our city
We funk him outta town
Ya'll ready 
Blob you goin' down
But the war continues
Thanks to every last one of you courageous Funkaneers
Atlanta can sleep tight tonight
Because you faced your problems head on
You didn't run away from 'em
And that's how true players do it
They get straight to it at ease soldiers

Ran into a night owl rollin' White Owls
Girl it's been awhile since I hit a White Owl
I'm with it though she a centerfold
Big ol' blunt look like tentacles
She strip in Europe Interpol
Don't remember her in her clothes
I fucked her friend damn they was close
Let's reunite let's get em close
Hit 'em twice in a row hit a flight and I'm ghost
That's the last time I seen her though
She be gettin' too eager ho
Stamp it like it's my visa
Cheefin' off of these berries
When the world gets heavy and it hurts to carry
I'm her Midnight Mercenary Fiend

She take me to a place that I never would discover
Might never have another so I had to fuck her
Reach into my pockets damn I ain't got a rubber
See my nigga Ron like L. Ron Hubbard he be outta space
Say he got a case of straps at the back of the hotel cupboard
Check by the safe she say Boy you got it made Do you got a cape
I ain't with the games ma do I gotta wait
I'm quite impatient intoxication got me feelin' like procreating
Girl I'm the baker you surely caking
Stand back catch my amazing graces
Photo finish and fornication
Do you believe in love
What's your drug What's your drug 

Take it all the way from the beginning
Now comes the question of which intro do you use
Do you use this intro or the other intro I was talkin' on 
But then that lets people know I had more than one take
So maybe we should just not use this and use the other intro
So people would think I just took it straight through

You'd be surprised how many truths you can hide in flows
I'm listenin' to this beat with my eyelids closed
Thoughts keep flashin' and I keep laughin
I never thought that I would fuck Irish hoes
Maybe Asian bitches or Caucasian bitches
Remember when I got to New York I was lost
Because all I ever saw was Jamaican bitches
I ain't barely know what Jamrock was
Lil' country nigga God damn I was
To you niggas talkin online until you make it this high
Then you could never understand this buzz well
Maybe if you put yourself in the shoes
Of a nigga comin' straight out the South
No gold grill just a east coast feel
And a set of crooked teeth in his mouth
Make them hoes bounce that can't get enough
Niggas say I made it I ain't make it enough
Man hang that nigga you a real lame ass nigga
If you ain't got my tape in your truck
Cole uhm world don't you forget that
I think I lost my mind round the same time I lost my six pack
But no sit-ups for me long as my dick still get up for me
Long as a ho still give up for me
She usually charge but she get us for free
Scared of the days you'll be seeing me
'Cause my girl do not play coach DNP
That's something for the hoop fans
Just copped her the coupe man
No drop top but a slot on the roof that can slide out
And get a little sun while you ride out
Ced on the beat let me vibe out
Writin' rhymes out momma made it happen
Could've been a lawyer but I made it rappin'
He made it rappin' now at the shows he the main attraction
Another shot of Henny so I'm faded askin'
How long do this drug called fame be lastin' 
 
I'm on my night job my niggas riding my city understand us
See a hundred bandits each put a hundred bands up
They can't call us bandits no more
Same hood same corner store
But them same old hoes ain't wearing panties no more
I'm on my night job slim waist with them fat thighs
Never been baptized but she soak me all in her holy water
I'm one of five she the only daughter she ain't used to sharing
I ain't used to caring let's play truth or dare
'Cause lately my lifestyle's like dynamite
I'mma go lights out like Dyna might
Smoke one that I might I'm on my night job
Always knew how to play these cards of mine
Fuck rap we seen harder times
Jump back like Vinny Carter prime

I'm on my night job y'all niggas jivin' I'm back up in position
Earnhardt I'mma catch some nigga slippin'
Burn hard on a track and get to whippin'
I'm on my night job why is it always blacks that get detention 
For my nigga with the pass to get the flip in
Boy that trap is a accurate description
I'm on my night job finally got Bassy off the corner
I'm on my night job flew the posse out to Rome and
Nigga word to Selassie I'm zonin'

Got old niggas tryna bite 'cause they can't capture
The feeling from days before the game passed 'em
Niggas out here lookin' like a bunch of Dame Dashes
Nicorette that's patchwork
That ain't better than your last work
Cigarette let the ash burn
Omen said don't worry 'bout the last word

Too high to riot that's my best excuse for being lazy
Being an artist that's the best excuse for being crazy
I've been so infatuated went to Clark and graduated
Now she on my face time and my nigga she just masturbated

Fuck a album release party I'm out in the streets shawty
How many rappers I killed counted at least forty
Nah I ain't God but shawty down on her knees for me
I'm horny like that Coltrane album
A Love Supreme that's cold-fame album
Lately I've been dancing like a Soul Train album
Lately silly making songs talkin' 'bout how they hate me
They've been loving me this whole time
My only adversary was my own mind
Killed my ego now I'm snappin' like it's ten years ago
With a gold mine of inspiration for y'all
Fuck your co-sign that nigga can't fuck with Cole neither
Don't ask for a feature we bring a whole liter of ether
To eat ya we got heat for niggas keep reachin'
If these bullets was heat seeking
They wouldn't even reach you niggas
I'm on my way my nigga just made bail

My nigga just made bail
Great health cheers to that
Do this shit for Queens got my ears to that
They hate us but not more they hate theyselves
I guess that they gotta motivate theyselves
We can never correlate you will never see my plane
Right in front of you but your vision is so plain
I see it more vivid seen it all did it
Round these fake fucks still keep it authentic granted
Give or take fucks how your measures rate us
Damnit you'll never understand it
And even though I'm so lit
I've seen the cards handed and I replayed mine
Hell yeah I'm on tilt
But I'm never off handed gotta keep good time

Free your mind and everything'll follow won't you

My nigga just made bail

Listen when you get a blessin you don't ask why
You just pass forward and fast forward
All my niggas from the hood got a passport
And them girls already know we ain't ask for it
Said she from the hood but her ass foreign
Drive a Malibu but her gas foreign
Her aspirations I can't relate with
But I'm like a ghost 'cause my ass tourin
Burn holes in all my clothes
But I got merch and this cash for it
Glass floors and no ceilings
How I wish we could both feel it
For all the ones gone 'cause I miss your breathing
Any y'all saw came any y'all part
Gotta race cars
Penny my thoughts nah this shit premium
Bas

Free your mind and everything'll follow won't you

My nigga just made bail

And everything'll follow got to
Free your mind and everything'll follow gotta
Free your mind and everything'll Cole

My nigga just made bail
Tell the good Lord we gon raise hell
We gon pop off like a fake nail
Take the top off and get ill get ill get
My nigga just made bail
Tell the fuckin mayor he got hate mail
Less shakedowns and more Shakespeare
Please all these niggas don't care
Prepare for the new shit that Cole is the truth shit
Nigga this is Lu shit nigga this is Bas shit
Meaning this some true shit telling you shit
Bout the crew how we do shit who sick 
And tell my niggas in the two-six in the coupe
I'mma kick back smoke a pool stick
This for my new chick tryin get fit say she too thick
Ain't no such thing as too thick what you wanna be a toothpick 
What you wanna get your cooch licked 
Well I'm tryna get my flute played
If we the new slaves
I am Frederick Douglass of rhetoric ahead the of the others
You motherfuckas better get free
This for that insecure girl your name I won't mention
On Instagram straight flickin'
Bitch you a nipple slip away from strippin'
Might as well get your clientele up you a pioneer
Them girls fuck for free I'm never buying there
Save that shit for the D.R
I rock crowns and these niggas rock tiaras or tiaras
'Cause I'm Pete Carroll left college and I fucked the pros up
Guess it ain't luck when the luck just shows up
Like every verse on the spot shit is never rehearsed
You heard it first Bas

Y'all ain't ready I got Bas the Genius over there

Free your mind and everything'll follow won't you won't you
They putting prices on heads silver or lead
I pray the scores settle before the devil notice you dead
Got me smoking the potent my eyes open and Otis they red
Thoughts of my eye roam and words that I hoped I had said
That aunty sippin on we missin ya
Even tho you gone your thought alone can lift us up
This is us
Got some niggas never call me 'less they need something
My niggas know that I love 'em
Give 'em roses while they can smell 'em
'Cause ain't no tellin' who'll be here tomorrow
Used to borrow your digital scale
Flippin' them sales
But now it's digital dash while you're still in the past
Boy trust me when I tell you the picture got much bigger
The swishers and dutch fill up
Bitches in lust with us
Momma would dissapprove losing my way
Lost in the sauce this bolognese is so amazing
Had a talk and she remark you so engaging
Running game it's all the same
I'm growing jaded
Had a couple things in common like Lonnie Lynn
But I'm too faded for conversatin'
I'm sittin' here contemplatin' how to win
 
Time keeps slipping away
Another day another love song hey

Cousin in jail again asking me for bail again
Close when I was twelve but I was much frailer then
He was like sixteen a nigga from the gutter and
Years ago his favorite uncle had married my mother and
Here we are runnin' through the Ville like dumb and dumber and
For that summer man I swear I wish you was my brother then
Well time passed and we fell off 'cause you moved back home
Little did you know Jermaine done grew a new back bone
Niggas thought he wouldn't make it 'til he proved that wrong
Twelve years later on the radio that Who Dat song
Your homeboy bumps the Warm Up now you buggin'
And niggas looking at you like you lying but you wasn't
Next thing I know you blowing up my line all a sudden
And I'm showing love saying yo look what I did
Man nobody coming from here ever did this shit this big
Same niggas showed you how to rap now you don't know how to act
Boy I'm at the bottom you could pull a nigga out of that
Put me in a video yo put me on your hottest track
Bring me on the road with you
And I'm strapped up if them niggas act up
See you headed to the top you need to let me catch up
I'll see you when I see you
Harsh as it seems to say I wouldn't want to be you
Bail you out for your daughter and I pray to God
A nigga never pull your card or she won't ever get to see you
Got a whole tank of dopamine flush it
You're only as low as you think fuck it
Your never as low as you think man your never as low as you think

A moment of silence with words that he heard on the phone
Strapped up just like a Platoon won't find no Oliver Stone
He had four brothers when he was sixteen and my nigga now all of them gone
I break a pound of that loud I smoke it all on my own

Look I'm at work like fuck it man
I might flip and tell my manager to suck it man
Whats two hundred dollars a week
Got aunties got my brother my sister my father my mother
And this mop ain't the only thing right in this bucket man
But back to mopping like fuck it man
Know I got a lot things coming man
I know a lot of niggas doubt but they don't understand that
Ain't no limits to what God can prove
They told me this life wasn't logical and I showed my niggas it was possible
Like fuck an obstacle 'cause this wasn't even in the plan
And now I notice what I got to do
And I'm not just going to shine I'ma blind you too

Shit 'cause I ain't rich enough
I mean my father got a whip but ain't sick enough
My mother need treatment like she ain't been sick enough 
My cousin need treatment like she ain't been sick enough 
My God I mean before I die give me everything required to die knowing I did enough
And my niggas well they can never drink enough
Let me get a couple bottles get 'em liquored up
Young kings in the city so we feast like the royals sleepless
The city the only teacher the snakes in retreat
Don't retreat thats a coil
Straight from police they will seek and destroy you
Nigga no pirates homie I got lockships
I go Loch Ness on these fuck niggas can't fuck with us
They all boxed in might circle round and dump shots in
See Cole he might pop in and go beast mode
The new East Coasts them Queens niggas to them Ville niggas gone speak for it
Niggas know it I feel at home in like every city
My bitch body like Heaven pick me
I'm winning nigga I'm winning nigga I'm

A moment of silence with words that he heard on the phone
Strapped up just like a Platoon
Won't find no Oliver Stone he had four brothers when he was sixteen and my nigga now all of them gone
I break a pound of that loud I smoke it all on my own

Never mix soil in blood but I still call them my own
I call them my own I know that's my own
I've been doing the wrong drugs all along

Good things don't happen to good people
People never change
Pupils dilate my frame
Make my vision so exquisite
While my cousin dead and gone
I can't wait to go and visit
Father time don't deny me
I just need a couple minutes
Exercise my better nature
I've been holding up these bridges
Nigga's always take advantage
Olive branches start to splinter
Giving way withering turning colder than the winter
And my city but the center feels no pity this for me this for me
I'm just reaping what I sow
And I've been sewing for my nigga's in the snow
Let them know that I be sewing
Never slow to know your pain
I'll be back before you know it
Left the town a drug dealer
Came back a fucking poet
Let me grow

I need to leave this shit alone
I've been doing the wrong drugs all along
Niggas'll sell you any dream where I'm from
That ain't molly my nigga that was methylone
Lone

Last week I bought a testing kit I wish they made em for people
The way these nigga's be actin they should be cast in a sequel
Nigga's phony they only give you dap just to reach you
I know ain't the first homie to have to tackle these issues
Hov told me D'evils
Got the best of him then they get the best of me now
Without a Reasonable Doubt
When nigga's acting irrational hard to reason it out
I had to kick down the doors I had to leave a few out
Door mat

I need to leave this shit alone
I've been doing the wrong drugs all along
Niggas'll sell you any dream where I'm from
That ain't molly my nigga that was methylone
'Lone

That's ok
My bitches know I'm a fiend
But that's ok
They just love me for me

I need to leave this shit alone
I've been doing the wrong drugs all along
Niggas'll sell you any dream where I'm from
That ain't molly my nigga that was methylone
'Lone
I need to leave this shit alone
I've been doing the wrong drugs all along
Niggas'll sell you any dream where I'm from
That ain't molly my nigga that was methylone
'Lone
Said I'm calling all my niggas with me riding
Dressing room like we keep bitches on the rider
Bus full of white girls singing Akinyele
Momma I think I just met me a Madonna
Everything glowing ain't a diamond
I know everything glowing ain't a diamond
Girl you shining

But I ain't felt love in a long time and I told you that when we woke up
I guess that might have been the wrong time
My best pick up line is young nigga with money I ain't playing
My best pick up line is young nigga with money

Killing these niggas I got a feeling these niggas is out to get me but trust me I got 'em
Straight out the borough my city love me we thorough
My nigga you don't want none of them problems
She acting crazy she calling me baby I just be feeding them bitches the bottles
She live in way up in Harlem but she come to me when I call her
And she all about her fashion she be working for Vogue
Me I'm all about my stacking I be working the road

But them clouds never get old
Them clouds never get old

So focused on make the dopest song
Got this chick open on got her lit on patron
Got her ticked off 'cause I got no tick for her
I got no time but I got some dick for her now
She was lit I was milk
Girl don't let that milk spoil
You got some friends that stress you
He ain't loyal I got some friends don't let 'em think for you now
Pull up the whip for you now here go the town
I am no pimp but I am a player
You not with the shits I'll talk to you later
I'm playing girl I got a thing for you now

But I ain't felt love in a long time and I told you that when we woke up
I guess that might have been the wrong time
My best pick up line is young nigga with money I ain't playing

Throwing fishing nets in the ocean to cash
Good catch here's to hoping it last nigga
And bring them hoes back to the pad from the show
But only if they know how to act nigga
Don't ever get stuck on your laurels like
All of them stuck in the past niggas
Shit it's how I got past niggas

Said I'm calling all my niggas with me riding
Dressing room like we keep bitches on the ride up
Bus full of white girls singing Akinyele
Momma I think I just met me a Madonna
We ain't buyin' none of that
None of that

Look at 'em sippin' the sauce
You niggas been rippin' us off
You niggas just talking the most like
Pockets is full of the hope homie
Tell 'em we came for the dope only
For the dope only
Benjamin Franklins them folks owe me

Word to Soulo my nigga
I got the loud and it's lit
Went to college a bit
Pissed off my scholarship quick
Now I'm back in the town
I'm back in the town

A nigga been searching for purpose there's nothin' around
Back in there makin' my old moves wrong move
Play the game and nigga no rules poor you
You could probably lose your soul too dancing with the devil
The seeds were planted back in the days
I guess I learned my lesson
'Cause now a nigga at London on tilt
With the G's ballin' like we watch film
If you talking Queens nigga please
Them niggas reaching we sould put em on stilts
I know we cool and all but cool it y'all they pullin' off him
My nigga who are y'all Don't get my crew involved

Look at 'em sippin' the sauce
You niggas been rippin' us off
You niggas just talking the most like housewives
Pockets is full of the hope homie
Tell 'em we came for the dope only
For the dope only
Benjamin Franklins them folks owe me
And we ain't about none of that shit

Millions soldiers get a re-deployment
'Cause ain't no leader here that we appointed
We the only one's that matter now
Fuck your style this ain't dappered down
Wear my own shit still hittin' bitches like it's batter round
Call me spring training
I've been whiling but I'm maintaining
Dawg whole borough watch me
Fiends boys from the block
But we got hoes in the lobby
A tree grows from the concrete
Like he rose to the top
Cocky them boys finna flop
But not me your boy been alive

Look at 'em sippin' the sauce
You niggas been rippin' us off
You niggas just talking the most like
Pockets is full of the hope homie
Tell 'em we came for the dope only
Benjamin Franklins them folks owe me
And we ain't buyin' none of that shit
You niggas just talking the most like Housewives

Lately I got this feeling
My niggas is meant to get it
It's written up in the stars
Made it from slimmer odds when only God was with us
Fuck it nigga we did it been picking the game apart
My response for critics is spitting it from the heart
Ain't no frontin' involved
They feel it I'm 'bout to make niggas fold
Something in the water got me floating like the work across the border
Girl I wonder how we making it home 
I'm no angel I got an angle
Back to the crib bitch I'm tryna get you naked and bone
She's no angel but with the blow she's a snow angel
The dangers of taking her home
She said You caught my eye and my ears
You speak sincere write precise
Cross your t's and dot your i's
See my fears and read my mind
If lawyers steal and doctors lie
What'sreally left for you and I

Trust shit I don't know too much about it
We can take this leap of faith

I don't wanna feel the bottom no
Girl I don't wanna feel the bottom

And I just called up my mama she missing her son
I've been pulling all-nighters and missing the sun
I heard it gets addicted to some
The bigger the light the quicker they come
They exit your life just as quick as they come
I'm numb to it like a brick to the gums
I get to it just as quick as it comes
As quick as it comes now
I wish niggas wasn't so addicted to power
I wish heaven had visiting hours
I wish we could hit the Ave like we used to
Dime nickel twenty bag like we used to
Ride with my dawgs moving cross the States
Die by my word that's an author's fate
So how your shoulders holding up fine great 
I got the weight of the world on mine I'm straight
Now pay your dues til your dues paid
Play your role til your role change nigga rotate
'Rari or Jaguar switching forth lanes
Call me for NASCAR Bassy a track star
Gassin' the track like I'm running propane
Lapping these niggas and jealousy's a bitch
Made it out the city look around
I brought all my niggas with me
And I gotta thank God for the felonies we missed
Gotta thanks mom dukes gotta thanks pops too
They say anything possible
My squad like apostles believe in me
Don't know how to quit that's a fiend to me
Yeah my niggas flood proof
Pray for the rain gotta deal with mud too
Gotta deal with slugs who
Lay six feet try to get above you
My niggas flood proof
Pray for the rain gotta deal with mud too
Gotta deal with slugs who
Lay six feet try to get above you
And hug you they sing your praises
They wear their faces backwards
Still I see 'em acting
Just the walking reenactment
Ain't nothin' real about 'em
Niggas talk about us
Spill they're heart up out us
They spill they're hearts
But what's her name again 
We talking 'bout lames again
Won't pretend I'm entertained
I'm going through the changes
I'm still the same
Everybody feel you don't feel your pain
Go on go on still I hold on to you

'Cause I don't wanna feel the bottom no
I don't wanna feel the bottom
Said I don't wanna feel the bottom no
I don't wanna feel the bottom

I guess the lights that been shining a lot brighter
Let's have a drink with the girls from the videos

If I wasn't preoccupied self-absorbed yourself alone
I left you with I got the world
Still felt alone and ever since been lost in the stars
Missing on what Heaven sent godly
I'm faulty I'm fraud maybe
Probably was the reason that your dog hate me
But fuck that bitch like the law baby
Girl I'm just playing but I'm off though
We should grab a drink before we link up at the crossroad
Pick it all apart
I guess the lights that been shining a lot brighter
Let's have a drink with the girls from the videos
I must have been through this one 'til my past life
I see the pitfalls dodging the difficult

Can't remember last night a nigga under Xans
My haters I lost sight can't see 'em under Bans
My niggas yell let's ride
they see I got a plan
Me I understand I just understand it
I pray to God when I see how far we've come
Tears of joy I think we could drown the sun
And let that marijuana twist up
Put me right up in the lineup never been sub
I'm next up never mind when we get snubbed
They getting Michael Jordan Harold Miner mixed up
We gone show 'em that Dreamville this year
We gone show 'em that when the people come together ain't no holding back
And that's the only fact
I been holding back tears for these young black souls lost in the past year
Some by the law they ain't even flash steel
Some by they own dogs most by their own fears
And you can watch it all young nigga stand still
Fuck a line in the sand I put a line on the dot and leave you right where you stand and I'm just trying to understand

Rolling down the slippery slope stay on point I tippy toe it
Won't you smile it gives me hope
Pray that you forgive me for it
Rolling down the slippery slope stay on point I tippy toe it
Won't you smile it gives me hope
Pray that you forgive me for it

Been there before lust in my eye
Times in the past
Drowning my sorrows my fears speaking louder
In my head getting louder
I'm holding on tight darling
The roots to places I found
I'm closing my eyes closed
Now I'm back with you in my mind
I want you to be girlfriend

Reached into my mind for reflection
The truth is obscuring my perception
So take a hit on this shit feel the resin on our fingertips

Schedule that freely you can pick a day
We can roll em up and roll em up
So I can watch everything ricochet

Six months since I last seen you
Clip blunts in them ash trays
While we speak up on them past days
You know I still have faith
It's been ten months since I last seen you

Schedule that freely you can pick a day
We can roll em up and roll em up
Sit back and watch everything ricochet
Schedule that freely you can pick a day
We can roll one up and roll one up
So I can watch everything ricochet

Innocence lost it's never retained
It's never the same it's never the same
Leave this world with some inspiration
I'll take the bait before a pure of gold
Come to grips with your intuition
Hear the whispers of your soul
Steer you down the road you're on
It's all your own
Innocence lost it's never retained
It's never the same it's never the same
Leave this world with some inspiration
I'll take the bait before a pure of gold
Come to grips with your intuition
Hear the whispers of your soul
Steer you down the road you're on
It's all your own
Got them speakers in my ride
I like to keep 'em bumpin'
I'm hustling chasing dreams
In hopes that I could become something
I threw a party she say Bassy thank you but it's nothin'
'Cause I had to keep it jumpin'
Ya a'int Blake Griffin but I know that you be jumpin'
Poker face stiffin' but I know that you be bluffin'
No I don't be cuffin' all these ducks be gettin' ends
Rubber duck etcaeterin' and I'm the pain
I left to make and can't be ya crutch and meta

Piffy lined up fired up in the dutch
Or the EZ Widers slide up six speed
Like clutch the city on me I'm clutch
No Worries they depending on me I'm clutch
Toast up mimosas at thirty thousand feet
Henny in hand land can make it out my seat
Michelin man making grip up out the street
Grab The D cup on the freak played that bitch and press repeat
J-Walkin' thru time zones I'm on that trip
Got yo piece of the pie and you pawn that shit
I'm takin' all that shit until I own that sis
College shit get mind blown I'm on that quick
She got expensive addiction and a nose that's rich
Nothin' betta than brown dough that's on that stick
A lil' hashish shiish baby
If you roll it up with some keif Super Mook
Super Mook chasin paper 'bout my loose leaf
Rollin papers yeah I do chief
Meditatin' like I'm Bruce Lee at the Carter like I'm Tunechi
Riddin' thru the borough while this cutie feed me sushi
Salmon avocado and an order of the cuchie
Charles De Gaulle to JFK
Brods givin up the draws like I'm JFK
Guess I'm flawed after all ain't nobody perfect
Do it all just to ball and the shit is worth it

It's like that now
Quick fuck that let me get back

I'm in L.A. but my Jays got sand from Dubai
I'm getting brains all day like I'm Magna Cum Laude
'Cause while you boys planked I was getting more stamps
Now my passport shitting on your whole camp
Fuck ya Instagram that monkeys do delivery that instant gram
Damn put them ones up for them ones that's above us 'cause we miss them man
And to the niggas stuck up in the can
And slam a cage up in ya body put cha body up in a different plan
Different plain
Same hustle different game
They don't love you if they always wanted you to stay the same
Slidin' through the 'jects now I'm slidin' through the W with different dames
That's a W nigga figure that shit is game
I just keep doubling figures until my niggas ain't
Pedelin' pills and kaine
'Cause in the streets or the industry man them presidents still the same

I never lose sight
Got an eye on her thighs and an eye on horizons
Too much at stake got no time for a date
Unless that date is with fate got my eyes on the prize and
Its too occupant you want a slice but it's too hot just pie it
You want a steak but it's too high to buy it
Me I be too high I'm too high I'm too high
I'm too high for games and I'm too high for liars
Fuck TSA 'cause I'm too high for flying
Fuck NSA 'cause them satellites too high they do all the spying
Fuck all the leaders that's too high off power
They do all the lying and treat us like prisoners
I mean who is the enemy here 
You are or I am but you are not real enough power
Despite all the dirt that you're doing
You do all in hiding but I am no better
I can see all of your terrors
Still remain in quiet and wonder in private and silence
Like if I just speak on it would the people go buy it 
Fuck it just do it for self I am demand and supplier
I trial by fire I am the man

But I'm too high to riot I'm too high to riot
I'm just too high to riot
Bas you in the city 
Baby nah I'm on the road Fiends
Pockets full of money left them all on the floor

Probably should have claimed all the hoes that I fucked on my customs declarations
Check the faces all through my crew it's like every race
So to call me racist is so fucking baseless
But until your nation apologize
I fuck a European bitch for every African nation they colonize
And Add us some commas there to follow my dollars sign
And boost up my bottom line
And you don't want to hear it fine they used to make it a crime to fuck white women
But damn better give me a lot of time
Free love whole world mixed up fuck boy you out of time
So what could brown do for you UPS nigga
I done flew up out the nest nigga
The world bigger than the block man thats why they killed Pac
Couldn't stop us we still looking for the rest nigga

It's just me you Jack and Ginger
Mary's here my dear
No need to ask I'll bring her pour me a glass
I'm in my zone
And if it's mine that's you honey
Stick together like new money
Hit Dubai on that dune buggy
Catch some rays like it's Tampa Bay
And I know what drives you crazy
On how I switch daily
From love is so amazing
To love is so enslaving
Yet all you have is patience
Fight for us as if life is love
If love is gone it's dead life in us
I repent all my sins
Always trynna put knife in us
I hear my devil's enticing but
They run amok every night
They ain't nothin' but some pressure 'cause
Pressure bust
Promise for the two of us I never rush
It's just me you Jack and Ginger
Mary's here my dear
No need to ask I'll bring her pour me a glass

And she was like Lauryn Hill tell him
I was trynna be a player still on my Bill Bellamy
But she couldn't understand
'Cause everytime we go out we go out with a bang
She just want a taste
Fill up with regrets now you get em by the text
Bitch you never wear the smiley face ok
You can tell me bout it or you can tell it to the ace
'Cause we never let it go to waste
Don't you ever let me go to waste
Black star so we couldn't burn out
Like black cards we ain't gettin' turned down
My God gon' get the word out
That's laughter my bitch got ass like NASA
That line prolly only makes sense to me
That's fine I'm the shit to me

Why you so dramatic 

Mama told me you were getting sicker
Daily she'd call me say it's my name
You were calling I mean I was your favorite
I was named after your father you were the sweetest aunt
Never had kids of your own but you made me your own
Busy on the road I couldn't make it back home
You couldn't make it that long I'll never forgive my self
I think I love just the hurting fact
I think I love when you hurt me back
Til we under the dirt I keep you close
Yeah under my shirt
I keep you tucked to the side
I'm Mr. Jekyl I got something to hide
I fancy love but I get stuck off of pride
I hope you understand
I got a list of daily lovers
Succumb to the beast or become it live from the belly of it
Just trying to survive I'm searching for any others
Lets get together make the whole world believe us
New world allegiance fiends living our dreams out
Nigga believe it
Seen the world three times nigga believe it
They out here selling peace signs you niggas believed it
I don't
My behaviors unbecoming
My neighbors look at me funny like I should move out
Nigga you get a new house
This shit ain't easy
Multiple choices I had turned into voices I have
No where to run I'm moving forward and forging the path filling the loneliness path
Nigga this shit ain't easy
So spare me the front and the fake
You ain't put shit in the pot fuck is you touching the plate 
General guidelines to ride by
Can't kill my vibe you couldn't find mine
Come to New York City I'm in the skyline with a fine dime
And nigga we ain't fine dining
Hit the Halal stand for cheap plates
Hit the high line that's a cheap date
I ain't worthy fuck it who is 
Do what you do girl fuck it you lit
Hundred niggas yelling New York back
I'm in Queens to Harlem the Garden I rap
And I'm only hearing New York clap
Bout to move out to Califronia got a little thing out the valley
And this one girl at hollywood hookah
I wish I knew to show her how to maneuver
Truth through the city like a presidential motorcade
On my way so the motherfuckers don't shake
Never mind I'm just smoking that grade A
Running with the same niggas since grade eight
You ain't never seen no strange ones appear
My niggas been the same ones for years
I don't do it for the peers I do it for the fam
Man all of my angles are clear
Other day yo I was shopping on Rodeo
Got a call from my nigga Cheyo
Said the hood hot bro
Gotta get away yo
Losing niggas like every day
Told 'em eighteen months I'ma get a tour bus
Coming up and we never looking back
Need a rut to the cuts that bleeds deep
Three ducks in the truck like chirp chirp

Life is what you make of it's play-doh
This year this year man goes back to the moon

If you coming to my city wanna know the deets 
I'm the embassy I'm the one to see
Yeah baby yeah baby
From over here but I took it over there baby
Riding in the drop let your hair crazy
Climbing to the top going stair crazy
Crazy how the game opened up
A nigga ain't been home for some months
But when I get home I be posted up
Do it for the city til the coast is us
From a city where a nigga turn a penny to a twenty
But when the penny turns friends turn to enemies
As semis turn urns into memories
Make shots nigga burn like the Hennessy
The city got problems the city's so godless
I watch it all burn like it's heresy
Witchcraft for your bitchass which craft is you gift at 
I live in the moment the moment is timeless
I hear all your talk but you're so unaccomplished
Opinions are nonsense
And I ain't got time for opinions to process
These days I'm inspired by me and nothing else
Bottles of tequila and some weed and nothing else
You know my niggas with me and no one else
I ain't pressing you can hold them hoes sudden death
Got golden goals
Fuck a penny for your thoughts nigga anyhow
I just called my nigga Ron he brought the Henny out
Got them things in the Kool-Aid in this motherfucker
Like a gang of Gorillas in this motherfucker

That's a closed book when she with me got your bitch open
And she don't get mook when she with me got your bitch smokin'
Be alert be alert be alert be alert be alert be alert

No tats but my passport got plenty
How many these nights do I got in me
Couldn't really tell blind every day the same time
Picture every face drawn on got on a for sale sign
Me I gotta stay sharp can't afford a stale mind
See I'm 'bout my bread motherfucker
And I can't afford a stale mind
My city grimy that Rollie shiny well you can't afford to tell time
And they gotta take squats on the jail time
'Cause nobody got guap for the bail bonds
And they had to get street 'cause college ain't cheap and
Mama gon' eat if we gotta pop heat so be it
Puttin' in work Soviet and that shit work you see it
Put your latest work in a hearse and I send it to the dirt
Lil nigga that's where your CD is CC 'em
Ah put 'em on alert me I make art 'cause it's from the heart
Love me 'til I'm gone when I die you gon' have to hit a fuckin' museum to see it Bas

That's a closed book when she with me got your bitch open
And she don't get mook when she with me got your bitch smokin'
Be alert be alert be alert be alert be alert be alert

You always had to make it hard for me
But I'm a motherfuckin' star bitch didn't you know 
Can't you hear that applause for me 
My brother Ib told me some niggas just wanna be safe
And some niggas just wanna be great
Which one are you Let's go make history today
Let's go make history today
Boy use your brain only your heart can lead
You'll figure your way man this shit ain't for me to say
I come I love until my heart can't bleed
I'm on the road I guess it ain't meant for me to stay

Hey world your favorite movie is on it's called Attack On Niggas
The fathers that didn't pass they all stacked in prisons
But that shit don't get a pass no that shit don't get a grant
Might as well go fill a bag
Ridin' around no tinted glass
Why I can't have tinted glass 'Cause that 'cause suspicion
Cops flash like cinemax don't lack ammunition
Might as well go get a gap might as well go give it back
Don't know if they'll get it right but I know that we'll get it last
Might as well go spend a rack at a black owned business
Had my mind on hoes now I'm back on business that's real
Back to what's important I'mma build with you
'Cause you're here for me and I'm here with you

I'm here with yo
You never thought I'd make it this far did you
You always had to make it hard for me
But I'm a motherfuckin' star bitch didn't you know 
Can't you hear that applause for me 
Ceelo with the G's
Put the paper down rake the leaves
Piece of little weed
Nigga break it down pick the seeds
Fiend roll a swisher please
No promethazine got amphetamines
Got me on a devil lean
Sahara to the Gobi niggas know me to be hot as water
Not livin' for tomorrow got no time to borrow
Bitch I rep my borough
Yeah trust me Queens know
Fuck a knight in shining armor play for team No Daughters
Trust me she blows
Stop makin' demands bitch stay in your pocket
She eyein' my grands bitch stay out my pocket
She eyein' my man go ahead bitch rock it
We get it and split it I never could knock it
I look at the bar and I bet I could top it

Hundred racks just to drive off a lot though
Scenic route just to dodge all the potholes
Twenty racks at retail isn't it
'Cause the devil's in the details isn't it 

Ceelo with the G's
Put the paper down rake the leaves
Here's a lil' weed
Nigga break it down pick the seeds
Fiend roll a swisher please
'Cause the mook it give me epiphany
When hoes try to play me like tympani
Like Mighty Kong show me finer homes
And designer stones I want Tiffany's
Told her find a clone I know I'm kind of stoned
No trick bitch you can't get wit' me
'Cause I found my zone
Had to put on a form a good fit for me
I seldom see myself in dreams
I live this shit no issues wit' my self-esteem
Tunnel vision hear every station
Yo television I failed to mention
Frail attention in school dog
Failed attention that rude boy
Fire lit by my crew boy
To acquire shit that I'm due boy

Fall back or pass through
Matter fact that nigga that gassed you was ass too
Son we gon' last like tattoos
Ho nigga get a glass shoe why 
You can try it but you can't high tie it
That shit weak and you can't fight fire
I've been wired for days out in London town
I just lock shit down but I ain't got priors
Feelin' like the best nigga ain't that biased 
Fuck try it straight to the head but I ain't Lem Bias
From the ground up to them telephone wires
I hold down my city since Boys on Da Block
They gave me the key I done blown all the locks
Called a committee Queens in this bitch
I hit all the spots I brought all them with me
Never been petty don't got the time to be harboring envy
I'm Fendi with mine
Gucci bitch I got the plug I got whatever you need but I ain't got no love
Got something to say I don't hear it I can't understand
Your chatter don't make it across the Atlantic and I'm out in Europe
I'm wit' all my niggas I never take this shit for granted
The cards have been handed deuces is wild
Deuces is power deuces like two hundred twenty two thou
Deuces for love Cut it though deuces I'm out
I hope you figure it out

Shine black man melanin gold
I hope you never get old
Keep your youthful spirit
I know the world do fear it
You're the tip of the spear
And with our dyin' breaths I bet the world gon' hear it look
I been saving money for my taxes
Bassy keep on jumpin' through these brackets
I got twenty bitches coming back to the crib
I make sure my niggas got some racks what you need 
They gon' shoot through niggas like it's practice
I just make the money run some laps
Every time I pass go see the cash grow
We don't even act cordial we assholes
Bitches in my lasso is that so 
That's word to my last hoe I'm that cold
Runnin' through the town a black soul
My past froze twenty-nine times over
Look I have seen more than my time
Lived 9 lives for about twenty cats over I told ya
Everything you've done I done overdid I'm over it
Nigga Dreamville the whole coast how we shouldered it 
Them boys stale like toast when it's overdid
I hope they quit for real
But if they don't I got a million joints
I got the flow in pocket the emoji rocket how I'm outta here
A lot of em' sound like they in a talent show
So I give 'em something to remember like the Alamo
Tally-ho A high Joker like a Spades game
Keeping both eyes open wide rain man
Crew high on that fuck your life drank man
We slide in the bucket like paint
Never gave a fuck what you might think
Ran up in the club 'til they sent the lights in
Had to tell the owner please let the lights dim
Five more minutes see me a nice slim
Thick bitch with the you me and my grin
Tell her bring the crew you me and my friends
See where the night end with the right guy
Trust me and my kin speak with the right pen
Creep like the lightning in the night sky
Go deep Janet Jackson we back to back in
Black SUV's black tints would you look at that 
I'm booby-trapped in your fluid black skin
No groupie action your bougie accent
You're truly classic girl we outta here

Queens nigga with the Fiends nigga
Got the bean waitin' in the pocket ooh

I asked P what's poppin' 
He said we are nigga trips to Dr nigga
Got the borough jumpin' like it's J.R. Smith
Got no interest what you say y'all did
Smokin' blunts 'cause that's the way I live
Niggas dyin' front of their shorty wives
And their brother's ride on the other side
Every death is like a hundred lives
Flatlined from the black nine
I could feel the pressure multiplying
Make you feel like ain't no hope in trying
But we always trying
All this blood I bet it float to sea and wash out
'Cause they don't want you to see but watch out
Nigga watch out

See I want you to see
I've been through so many things
Things ain't always what they seem
Hope you get the message
I hope you figure it out
Now I'm right where I belong
Had to let it go
All the pain I was holding on
Now I get the message
I had to figure it out
You got to feel the music do you understand 
It takes you higher and higher
I been chasing the truth
But I've been waiting for you

Never had a day worth planning
'Cause every damn day is outlandish
I holla'd at Wave Bandana
My nigga is so high outlandish
I said we can hit the hood spot
My niggas do spray they canvas
Or we can hit the good spot
But Imma have to change appearance
I went to buy a cardigan
I seen you at the mall and then
My nigga was on your friend
They been steady two years now
But I never called again
And you ain't never fall off
So can I get on again
Breeze through the city baby
You would think I'm on to win
I think I was born to spend
I heard you was dancing girl
I think you were born to bend
I think I was born again when I found that pen mothafuckin' right

I been chasing the truth But I've been waiting for you

Never had a day worth planning
'Cause every damn day is outlandish
I'm going over sees outlandish
A nigga so high outlandish
Man I'm like a fly on the wall
And these four walls heard it all
I could hit a feline in your voice
But them words won't hurt at all
'Cause these broads gone leave til the morning
Champagne form bubbles in my bong
All I need is the love of my crew
Fuck you my borough know I'm on
Never been to work with a briefcase
But I'm still in each state
So my Momma text and said be safe
Saw one from my ex it said be great
First thought like she fake
What you want hundred replays
This shit is dead like Enyce
Dear Nefertiti I'm sure your'e a Goddess or
'Cause damn they look large them titties

She always on them up is when they go down
All she know is turn up girl slow down
Slow down girl slow down
Body type Mya face more Aaliyah
Stacked used to run track
Til she tore her knee up
Me I'm from Queens
And we up my last shit crack
Bitch I'm back with the re-up
Already caught the vibes
But I don't got the time
Girl I'm saying you should know
I be lying if I said I was surprised when you said you had to go
Met her out in France and her ass meaner
In them Euro hotels with the Ass Cleaners
Long ways from them days when we had peanuts
Looked back we just laugh like damn we up
She said let's go
Back to the bathroom to do some blow
Said you was sprinting you really shouldn't do that blow no more
Said I do what I do it ain't enough for a vote
Shit I done seen it's like ether to me
You don't know how I roll so you speechless to me
You niggas  don't get it you got it so good
I'm developing penis envy Pause
No Venus in me give a fuck if you niggas from Mars
You need to chill
I see the Coke in your jaw
You getting too aggy
You still got about half a gram in that baggy
I'm gone take care of this tab
And I'll probably just hail you a cabby

I been chasing the truth
But I've been waiting for you
I swear it feel like I swear it feel like
I swear it feel like a quarter to midnight
Riding in Dis 5
Bumping my own shit bumping my own shit
Pedal to the floor I ain't braking no more

And we get paid that's off words
And I been made ho that's my word
Ho that's my word
I ain't hitting you back i'm done with you hoes

Money growing farms gotta get your figures up
Gotta grow an arm before you pull your niggas up
Spend it on a bond money you was savin' up
And all they could respond is you never gave enough
Everything gratuitous
You don't want a pot to piss you want a pool to piss
Never taking it for granted like i'm new to this
Keep my waitress heavy handed fuck my stewardess
Who is this sick nigga Jealousy a trait saved for you bitch niggas
So wait bitch hold up get a hold of this nigga
Just got out the meeting and they talking big figures
But i'ma need more money than these drop a brick niggas
Convos and commas convos and K's
If that's what you talking ho convos for days
Sky so big got condos in space
Let's save the world all in good taste

And we get paid that's off words
And I been made ho that's my word
Ho that's my word
I ain't hitting you back i'm done with you hoes

I got us a worth that's the truest of it
A bird lose itself worth that's the Louie of it
Why so materialistic life will pass you egotistic
It's how the universe work that's the beauty of it
Seen you from the first twerk that's the booty of it
Lately been so hedonistic give me ass don't need no friendship
Living life all my tickets copped one way
And these bitches all in my runway
As of late I drink and smoke everyday
Hesitate just another shot you never take
Riding down the block in the Rari
Tryna' squeeze two hoes besides me
Six at the club turned twelve at the hotel
You would think these hoes Saimese
And they got hommies bodies
And they roll l's if I let them ride shotty
'Cause that's all it would take
Let's save the world all in good taste

And we get paid that's off words
And I been made ho that's my word
Ho that's my word
I ain't hitting you back i'm done with you hoes

Me I'm too fly y'all sweet y'all niggas fruit flies
Y'all speak y'all niggas hoopla y'all weak y'all hoop ride
I must be the coldest walk up in the room 
And ya bitch old i'm looking for some new's
I must be the coldest walk up in the room 
And ya bitch old i'm looking for some new's

Look at 'em sippin' the sauce
You niggas been rippin' us off
You niggas just talking the most like
Pockets is full of the hope from the quotes I never wrote
Tell em' me and my bro Doe Burger came for the dope only
Benjamin Franklin them folks owe me
Bassy told you my nigga I got the loud and it's lit
Went to college a bit but ain't pay off all my tuition
Now I'm back in the town from rapping for crowds
A nigga been searching for purpose
And guess what I found 

Pastor Black Lip join my diocese
Warn the people sleeping on the legion
I'm a Dreamvillain talking major keys
Think DJ Khaled playing Mavis Beacon
Soulo found the loud and lit it back woods
Back to back it's like I'm mad at Meek
Burning brain cells with my nigga that just made bail like last week
Still ducking strays in the plies like submissive bitches
With my dogs at the top and we in heat fuck all ya'll 'til I'm in the box
Six feet underneath the gravel casket made of 47 karat gold
Hear the trumpets blow Jesus banging the gavel

Soulo hold up let me get it back
Had to run the borough bring the city back
Got the power in my head
Been a year since I fit in fitted caps
Go and tell them niggas that Bas brought the East back eat that
Niggas play my album and repeat that
Niggas play your album hear them weak raps
And delete that's soft shit
Need some wheatgrass
Better boss up awh fuck
Got your bitch starstruck all fuss
Got five figures in my offers
My how the times have changed
I might leave tour and go buy the Range
I see the snakes I see the fakes
I see 'em straight through designer frames
I just got crib out in L.A
I get my pick at the thots but she can not stay
If she had her way she'd be picking the locks
Got a shower big enough to dance in
With your favorite singer and the dancers
In the party in the back booming
Rep the city like I'm Pat Ewing
Fiends high as bald eagles
And my product all legal
Word to Soulo my nigga
I got the loud and it's lit

Look at 'em sippin' the sauce
You niggas been rippin' us off

Like I do my Saint Laurents
She can't wait to take 'em off
Complimenting my expensive jeans
Turn your housewife to a thot-ty
Thought a bitch cadance made a thizz face
All these niggas do is copy wait what 
We ain't buying none of that shit that shit
For the birds and the fact is you just a gnat to a pterodactyl
However unbalanced that is this ain't about status
We cease and desisting y'all the teachers dismissing ya'll
Insisting you give it up
Cole World codeine in my cup
Fiends

Look at 'em sippin' the sauce
You niggas been rippin' us off
You niggas just talking the most like
Pockets is full of the hope homie
Tell 'em we came for the dope only
For the dope only

And we ain't buyin' none of that shit
You niggas just talking the most like Housewives

Word to Soulo my nigga

2 white girls and they both Beckys
Got me livin' like the nigga on the Dos Equis

If Ogee got them bangers than I go forever with flows
On a blank canvas Bas so incredibly dope
Giving light to my dreams I couldn't measure the scope
Turn that white into green that's Incredible Hulk
Man I'm so fly I see the heavens approaching
The Pearl in them Gates I'm burning a stogie than pearling a jay
My memory fades that's cool 'cause every day is a memory made
The Judge a crook he throw the book at every case
So we celebrate life that's for every occasion
I ran out of patience I can't be complacent
When niggas a take a limb and leave you with casings
My car it barely start it need a new AC
My star ripped out my heart and told me replace it
My job it never call I need me some wages
And you well you just need me to make it

You say you want me to have the world 

Hit it in the mornin' or the evenin' if that pussy good
I'm probably never leaving love do you still believe in love 
No it ain't real Damn not even us
She been down so long she gotta even up
Nevermind my intentions of Rari's and mentions
You see them hoes like it and now you get defensive
You prying in my mentions and I can feel the tension
You'd rather me a real job suit ay'  a pension
You feel I be a new guy as soon as it sets in
I feel I'm losing you bout' every second
Don't you get apprehensive we served a sentence together I know you down forever
Aware of what I got I couldn't replace it
You want me for me see the glory and base it
I love you for it 'cause you can't even fake it
A heart on the fringe you don't want me to make it
You don't want me to make it

It's you world
I'm out in Boca Raton
I'm sipping Roca Patron
I got this chick on the phone
Talking 'bout life and how I just ain't for her I been inclined to agree
'Cause all I been doin' is me
Now I can't be your one baby girl nah
But I play the two or the three now

Give her the dick and I'm gone
I'm like a ticking time bomb
I'm on the road grind time for the dough it's my time
She cheer me on pom poms
She good for the soul she good for the mind
She help me get found TomTom
She help me eat clean balsamic
She might end up meeting my mama
Let's take it back like western time zones
Used to call you up to share my milestones
Now you hear my voice and sound annoyed
Might as well be talking to the dial tone
I been living dreams it ain't what it seems
Splitting at the seam when it
Splitting at the seam when it come to you

I'm out in Boca Raton
I'm sipping Roca Patron
I got this chick on the phone
Talking 'bout life and how I just ain't for her I been inclined to agree
'Cause all I been doin' is me
Now I can't be your one baby girl nah
But I play the two or the three now

I flew out to Boca Raton 
Had to meet my nigga Bas 
He took a break from the road 
Decided to party with Cozz
Had to get away from the cold 
The Winter was killing my vibe
Just got off the phone with J. Cole
Told him that I'm with the guys 
Look in my eye I'm seeing life through Versace 
Dippin' in Mazi 'bout to eat Hibachi
Sippin' 'til I'm sloppy 
Fuck her 'til she knock knees
I put a hurting on her nani 
Anaconda through her body
Got her screaming Godly
Dale boom dale 
She a work of art like a Salvador Dali 
It's like a Prada robbery
Nothing but designer we can go shopping
You want the Zonda or 'Rari 
We could get both so you know this shit poppin'
Feeling like Tommy
In Belly when Keisha and him got it popping 
Put her head in my Tommy
Boca Raton I ain't leavin' this party

I can't help the way you think when I'm not with you
I'm not with the way you think when I'm not with you
Baby we know just what we got
Only we know just what we got
I can't help the way you think when I'm not with you
I'm not with the way you think when I'm not with you
Baby we know just what we got
Only we know just what we got

I'm out in Boca Raton

'Cause all I been doin' is me
Now I can't be your one baby girl nah
But I play the two or the three now

This a true flame this ain't butane
Who changed when you called Who came 
Still do never falter
You know I rock with you like Gibraltar
Ain't no pressure how 'bout me and you make a movie in memories
Remember now that's forever
Gotta love the way we put it all together
Lord knows I love the way He put you all together
You are stellar and I'm a champion
Clique full of real niggas living way up in the hills nigga
My next door neighbor's a Hilfiger
Big gate cops can't come thru
Got chicks down for the one-two
Got one thing she the one to
Lord how many of my dreams gon' come true 

With you I could be patient
Limousine that's a little tad much for you
Ain't no need put some weed in that blunt for you
We go deep girl we go deeper
I can tell when it mean that much to you

Don't front when you see me in the city and your friends they talk about me
Talking down about me how they say I ain't committed
What the fuck they know about me 
Told you everything there is to know about me still you doubt me
I got niggas in the state and the county and the city
All my niggas that escaped hundred grands to Sallie May let me get the record straight
We gon' see some better days facts
Bassy Bas the Basquiat of rap then basket my pain and left on my needs
Peel on these scars appealing to bars
It's something I need to function not me
It's nothing I need nothing like you so that's what I need
Looking for you and you and I need it got justice side
You to my dreams you were my angel viewing my demons
You are now in all of my sins I pray you're undo
All that I been I pray it come through I pray it come too
I pray it come true

With you I could be patient
Limousine that's a little tad much for you
Ain't no need put some weed in that blunt for you
We go deep girl we go deeper
I can tell when it mean that much to you

She fuck 'wit the team 'cause she love her some ballers
Opportunity rings and I'm finna call her
Got a backpack 'cause I don't know where I'll be tomorrow
I'm blowin' up spots bitch I got heat I used to have quaps
That's a quarter on the block fuck the cops
That's the order from a boss march on the court
House donors on the lawn tell 'em that we miss Trayvon
Mean it sincerely vision not twenty on twenty but I see through ya shit clearly
TV couldn't really impair me fear tactics don't scare me
Don't need no designer clothes but I'll take them designer drugs
Need a different kind of love Aladdin love Jasmine
Me I'd rather fly the rug

I just wanna smoke in peace ride through the open streets
I love my city and will do court but beefs claim lives like the open sea I still love my city if I die I couldn't find a better location
I don't go on vacation I don't go on vacation

Unofficial off the record it's impressive what you done to me
Mr. Hilton Mr. Westend but I fuck her like the DoubleTree
Lord I am just a 2 legged dog everything I do for my dawgs
Take another step and we will teach a lesson
Paramedics do get involved
Everybody in ya crew is a fraud everybody in my crew is a boss
'Cause everyone agree you ain't gettin' shit for free
Boy you gotta pay ya dues to the 'cause
All them hoes choosin' and hawkin'
It's my house take ya shoes when you walk in
And these hoes make appointments now
Me and my city like Christopher Walken

Vacation my vision is so clear my vision is so clear

Nigga so off couldn't hit a tee-ball
And you a grown nigga like 6 feet tall
Walked the line and he got chalked ball so hard that he got lost
Look at that lead on the wall all of my team gonna ball
We gon' leave 3hun of y'all lookin' Neanderthals
That look like y'all before a nigga evolved
Hope not hit her with the dope dick and my crib's the dope spot
I ain't got time for appointments that don't flock
And bitches that come back to my crib and don't pop
And niggas that smoke all my shit and don't cop
I see you muthafuckas

My vision is so clear I see you motherfuckers
Don't shit come between us
How we play dirty but step out the cleanest 
G shit bitch learn the meaning
From here to Medina I bag all the model chics
Call em Athena 'cause they are some Godesses
My politics don't got no policies just livin life everyday no apologies
Apologies for the delay I was up in the stars rollin up on astrology
Economies in disarray but a couple mixtapes gon put me in ecology
Ecology that's green nigga
Global Warming that's me nigga
Heatin up They ain't keepin up
Had a taste I ain't eat enough
Hoes fast like they let a whole day pass without eatin none
If the magnum rung Hemdi's the one
If them hoes open I'll leave with them

Should I tell my story 
Or should I show my scars 
This is Hemdi and Bas this is avant garde
Niggas swear they smart till they ass get snatched thru the fog
I got a couple bitches think they slick but far from espionage
Me and 3 bitches that's just a collage
I'm an artist of a rare kind you just a facade
The quiet sun metamorphosis I have just evolved
My horizon bright and I box thru life like Cus was involved
Muhammad Ali the Iron Mike-ness
If I lay somethin' down and it's war time nigga no women no kids that kill is righteous
Got blood on my glasses give me a second to wipe it
Lets proceed when it touch white folks I guess that's when it becomes a crisis
But we still in the ghetto where we chase money and hoes
The OG's said Thank you young fella
I guess nobody had the courage to write this
And we drive foreign cars But the evil drives us
And we ride on each other so easy
'Cause the demons ride us

You in a hot air balloon
You could be around the moon
You eat a pound of the shrooms
You'll never be higher than I am
You could mook all of the keef
You could blow all of the schneef
You go as high as you reach
You'll never be higher than I am
This is what I always wanted
Could never have done many thing
Where you quick taking me I might tumble
I'm trying will somebody make you just shut up about it 
Can we settle down baby 

I'm wired nigga on molly and Red Bull
Party with the fiends you know ain't no party in civil
2 devils on my shoulders and I'm just caught in the middle
Got decisions to make the decision's been made
I swear these bitches screaming YOLO fore they sniff the yola
Feeling like a Porsche 4 door used to feel like Corollas
My niggas still moving the yola till they fill the quota
Popo on em like they just paroled
And fuck the help they never showed em
So we outchea get it by any means
I'm on fire no lying them boys remind me of anti-freeze
And my engine keep running I'm supplying the energy
Ain't a thing you great a sin I'm high on the canope
Looking out for my niggas keep an eye on my enemies
Bitch I'm just where I plan to be
So fuck what you say
This a new CBA your favorite rapper's been amnestied
Don't pretend to be classy ho
'Cause I prefer nasty hoes
Test driving broads ho I'm a car show
Pockets all stinch if I see them narcos
Prolly gonna pinch nerf a nigga in the stick
The prison's like the man it should have gave us bar codes
Heart cold like it's waiting to be transplanted
Band wagon feeling guess I'm grant standing
Got them hoes on all 4's guess they can't stand it
Shouts to oak shades shouts to bandanna

And when we hit the pound that bitch black and blue
I spend a condo in the club two bottles won't do no

I check the homies and I breeze
And chickens hit my phone up say they only wanna please
Some niggas actin phony 'cause they only want a piece
I'll be it I see through I never deceive you

Since my niggas facin probation we gon smoke they faces off
Wish that we can smoke and smoke until we burn them cases off
I'm not too proud about not much to smile about
It's like they never took them fuckin braces off
Gunshots but ain't no fuckin races start
Either play your part and play it apart or play it raw hole in 1
Few hunned yards you a superstar groupies heart
But yo lady got the truest heart
I'm on the verge of greatness patience is the only virtue
But for the moment I'll be overindulging I see
Gracious faces greener passes gold chains purple fumes
Couple niggas still breathing but to me R.I.P
Til that hole is big enough for you to fit in
I don't need credit I don't need a fuckin credit limit
Me and my team travel like we never learn to pivot
And spend it in cities where bitches numbers be like twenty-one digits
How I'm supposed to dial that when I'm high as that hah 
How was such a chilly breeze flowin from yo eye and flash
I thought fire breed new life but niggas is dying fast

I'm on a pill think I love this bitch that's how real it feel
Sniffin out a Benjamin that's the cleanest bill
Poisons infiltrate my regiment and even still
I ain't numb and under this I could feel it still

Sniffin out a Benjamin that's the cleanest bill
Poisons infiltrate my regiment and even still
I ain't numb and under this I could feel it still
Why the police pull me over wanna see ID and registration
Them papers don't show you my dedication
I done came up like David Blaine
Y'all niggas don't know bout levitation
It's for the takin' shots up no hesitation
No head fakes I ain't never waitin'
Me and mines these are bonds that ain't never breakin'
Building blocks 'til the ceiling pops
Y'all killin' time that's record pacing
Dreamville shit record breakin'
Been cookin' up since my parent's basement I'm still cookin' these records blazin' you hear this shit 
I don't see you niggas I just see myself on some mirror shit
Re-decide before I pull your blinds
Ain't no seeing eyes on my pyramid
Joke nigga you serious startin' shit but I finish it like a period
And you still a bitch like a period and that's real
I'm looking at my receipt like goddamn it that's my receipt
She do it with no hands but damn it she wide receive
Super Mookin fiends bitch we the new elite
Locally overseas been so well received
This is life like 3 strikes of felonies
3 times ahead of niggas don't know a better nigga
I need a sweater with some gold lettering
A tour with thirty busses that my niggas go hammer in
And we could through all the litigation we ain't settling
Callin' all the pots black but we ain't kettling
Standing at the door won't you let us in 
Kick it down going places we ain't never been
You tryna find a torch and we just laugh at your misfortune
Staring out the window 'cause this life is in full motion
Make a movie out the B roll the action keep you focused
Fuck your token of appreciate I need payment
Nothing say thanks like a whole bunch of O's
And some pretty little hoes when anything goes and
I'mma shoot my shot if she open
I said I'mma shoot my shot if she open

Uh I've been lookin' at you all damn night
You the cookie I've been lookin' for my whole damn life
Bitches early this a long ass night
Shorty bust it and suck it and all that right yeah
She was on that white all last night
Did it off me man she skied my pipe
That pedico make her need that diaper
Shittin' on the game bitch I need that diaper

I'm afflicted sick like flu though
I'm the future like Pluto
All my niggas like kudos
All my bitches got culo
You can grab it and have it
Never thirsty I'm cool ho she let me thrash it like Pujols
Up at bat with elementary mathematics
I need at least two hoes and give me at least two hoes
That's fifty-six or fifty-seven pending on your connect and how much that nigga respect it
'Cause check it to a fiend
It's more than a gram you understand 
Ain't enough snow in the sand you understand 
Bitch don't jump in the lake it's all sharks
My nigga it's money to be made I want parts

Strange highs no day jobs new address
Old vice new temptress
Settle down one day this is practice
Where every coach is a model or an actress
Fiend
I just wanna meet some lawyer bitches
Fuck that I just wanna meet some loyal bitches
So like Christmas Eve I just toy with bitches
Got hoes on beans like they Goya bitches
But you won't see my shoes wet
What you sayin ain't paid my due yet 
Well fuck boi I be on the road still puttin work in the Duet
Fuck nigga can you hear it Me and your bitch gon sing a duet 
No hero to them hoagies
'Cause hoes get loose like bogies
If my nigga ask for it he could have her I could only have two left
Broads all look from afar see the same view
Could accept who you are till they change you
Can't lose what you ain't choose

Ironic I was just lookin for a lighter but I found you now lets go

What we about to get into 
Stuff that's illegal in America but legal here
A bunch of weed smoking and bitches
Embarrassing the family name
Let these niggas know Bas got sicker flows

Ego bruised you come through
With ice packs I come through
I'm on my Dubai swag
My Dubai swag my Dubai swag
All these bitches on me 'cause I
We gon leave the party ain't gonna
I'm the homie so he's next that's tax bitch

I still remember the cold of last winter the struggle was heavy
Cole was like I was just playin' your shit you know Salaam Remi 
He fucked with your tape he was impressed just as soon as I played it
I was so geeked I turned to the fiends like nigga we made it
He told me just got an offer for you it came through it was No ID
Then we pulled up to the club in a truck but a nigga had no ID
He went online on his phone just to Google and show em my faces
My nigga when they let us in that bitch I was like nigga we made it
Shout out to Dion he tried to put me on I mean it I'm gracious
But we had a dream build a home for the team so man we couldn't take it
But just see you later man Cole hit me up and say Interscope paid us
I asked how much and he was like nigga we made it
The very next day nigga I hit the bank and I emptied my savings
Oh what a feeling to put this shit simply its simply amazing
Spoke to my pops he said damn I miss Paris I need a vacation
I sent him two tickets for him and the misses like nigga we made it
Tell mom I love her
We gon make it baby no discussions
Bas is nasty spit disgusting
Gunna and five hundreds know a nigga hustling
Got a twenty Fuck it cop the buds and eat some Ruffles
Far as mook We gon need a duffle
Do it by the book Nigga we don't need a duffle
No police no more trouble
But I'm troubled got a homie who ain't heed the warning till they slugged em
Now we miss em and we love em
Yea we love em
Lord I just wanna see his face 
I browse the profile page of my homie slain
I saw a post from a lady and this is what it say
I cried when you passed away I still cry today
Although I loved you dearly I couldn't make you stay
Live the Land of the Free but we missin' the brave
They tell me Remember me when you hittin' the stage
In the darkness of night I'm just missin' the days
That's why I spit on this mic like I was kissin' the grave

I used to know this girl she was the Devil in disguise
One look in her eyes
You would turn to gelatin
She only fuck with rappers if you ain't one you irrelevant
Only fucks with athletes if you ain't one then she take off like a track meet
When I rap she know exactly what I'm saying 
And when a nigga ball she know exactly what I'm playing now
If we go to eat she look at me till I'm paying now
You're a groupie Say it loud say it proud 
Bitch you lazy or you just a fool 
Shout out to Misha had her baby and still finished school
I'm a believer
One day I'ma sit on a stool
On top the world and remember I used to sit on a stoop
Never swerve in the coupe
When it's work in the coupe
Now I pirate the game tryin' to earn me some loot
Stop being Nazi you better serve me my soup
But this ain't Seinfeld
I flip that like some clientele

Rhyme a few bars so I could buy a new car
And then I kick a few flows so I could pimp a few hoes
Rhyme a few bars so I could buy a new car
And then I kick a few flows so I could pimp a few hoes
Let the hecklers heckle
I am still puttin' up shots like the Heckle and Koch
I won't set foot in the box
I am the chef on the double shift
I just be cooking a lot
I got a zip and its rar
He taught us his breathing

Don't fall off your high horse ain't Christopher Reevin'
Ain't nobody grieving nobody missing
Married the game but she nobody misses
Can't blame the guns why don't nobody miss
Bring back my niggas now nobody missed
Back to the subject your body miss is like nobody maybe you Godbody
Tell me are you Artemis or you are remissed
Don't sell yourself short 'cause you are the shit a true art 'cause you are legit
Nonstop see me all seasons
Of that plane movie
I'm like Liam Neeson
Bitch I don't need no reason between me and you
It's all for the taking you workin'
Naw you just working on bitches that fake like they ain't
But they all for the taking too
My last shit's dope and my drop finna kill more niggas like Taken 2
I've been making moves what the fuck you doing
You line up for sneakers they line up for me
Get your head up straight boy your lineup funny
Just another story in the game
But every story ain't the same
But if you change can you change back
It's a shame that I came back

But my niggas wouldn't let me hold no weight
They said Bas you gonna make it get us out this fuckin' place
Anywhere we wanna take it Tokyo Makow
Make hoes make french toast and bow
Dinner at Del Frisco's
Houses in every zip code
I'm headin' out to Califronia nigga you should see my rent though
I'm fuckin' with the vibes this shit a different tempo
I never need a mink coat we makin' strides
But I swear this shit is never simple
I'm trying to keep my lady
She never had a baby
I know she got the kid though
I sent more and pondered how to do that
'Cause I ain't too good at love but I know how to do raps
Write it like MJ playing the twenty-three
Wiser my age I've been graying since twenty-three
Everyday it's like twenty beats I feast
'Cause everything on my plate the fiends they just relate
We ain't even there but bitch look what we made
New York New York my city that is my state
My niggas going to court for ballin' love of the sport
Supply and demand let's call it love of the snort
Let's call it love of the snort and all of the sort
It push me harder and farther
My father pushin' seventy don't want him dying a martyr for me
For his guidance I'll be grinding till he's off of his feet
I pray it all come from me
This shit is all for the fam the rest is all for the team fiends
Never once slide type clique
Never untie hit the ground like a bus ride
Shake the town like a mudslide

Queens shit fiend shit
Queen bitch roll blunts seamstress
To my real bitches and my real G's salute thee
Ironic I was just looking for a lighter but I found you
Now let's go and fuck the night up 
Let's go and fuck the night up

Ain't no bruise if you sticking moves
As far as I see it I mean it
Calm a spade a spader a dog a dog shit yea ho I be it
Uh I got green on my mind
A fiend I need to get mine
She say your dough my glow a little greener than mine
But your soul ain't cleaner than mine
If you looking for a diamond gotta find it
Go deep in the mines
And my game fucked with a bitch brain
I can go so deep in her mind
Couldn't keep her I'm fine nothing lasts forever
My whole life patched together
And life ain't a fucking joke
But we smoke fuck and still laugh together
I said cool it girl you know life is short
Uh or whatever
You say you wrong boy see mind in a long war since forever

Yo what exit is this 
We probably gotta take it to the last stop
Yeah 
I don't know I just made that up But I always figured like Amsterdam last stop 'Cause it says that on shit
That last train we were on was going straight to Belgium
I mean look ask somebody I guess
That waffle we had earlier was . Shit was good as hell
How far is Amsterdam do you know 
It's about fifty-five minutes
Fifty-five minutes from here Alright thank you Amazonian queen
Could you be what you seem Amazonian queen
 
Vines in the ravine
Swing down from your throne and bow down to your king
What a life we chose nothing but hoes
The good ones few and far between getting hard to see 'em
Come on Eileen could you be my visine
I'm in need of your light could you be my high beam 
Only for a few nights I ain't quite what I seem
In your city couple times a year you know what I mean
Yea you know what I mean
Bitch you know what I mean
Girl you know what I mean
I don't move keys but I got room keys
All the salty women leaving on a sour note
All the sweet ones end up chiefing on my dab of smoke
Only evening that's in question we was laid up at the Weston
Keep some candles that be scented until it does
Fuck you think the towels for 
For the loud gotta dampen the sound yea
Gotta dampen the sound yea
Quarter water raised me
From a boy to a man
Like the shore to the sand nigga I'm just tryna be free
I got a plan that you wouldn't understand
Inmates to the man now the BC's
See this is Attica for the soul
Revolution barricade all the doors
Let 'em know my soul ain't for sale
And won't be concealed in no type of cell
A cubical the resistance different than a cuticle shit is beautiful
When they try and break ya but they couldn't graze ya
'Cause you high up in the sky
Nigga why you admiring the pie 
Come get you a slice before these muhfuckas eat it all
But life ain't cake full of trials and tribulate
But we good 'cause we beat 'em all
My maker hold my fate and I know we got a date
So I'm good if I don't see tomorrow
I'm scrapin' up the plates stuffin' life in my face
Just in case I never see tomorrow
Just in case I gotta see the morgue
Well in that case I hope I see Allah
And ask him why he had to take Amir
Man I really miss ya it's been too many years
I see you and your sisters I see you and your kids
I see my aunt crying man she spilled too many tears
But know this fuck showbiz
If I make it anywhere your kids already there
And boy you know we think about you every year
Every month every week every night in my sleep
I hope you come and visit like you do my pops
Man I just wanna kick it like we used to
Allah please give a nigga blues clues
Why you take him Why you spare me 
'Cause I remember clearly
Sounds in my ears of them bullets flying near me

Look girl I see the sun is comin' up
What the fuck is up Girl you trynna cut a rug or what 
If you trynna front bitch I ain't the one I ain't the one
Don't be trynna stunt got some bud and one vanilla dutch
Roll another blunt mooked
Got you slow-mo so even if we rush by the time I cut
It'll be feelin' like a couple months but it's only what 
Ten minutes in this rented truck
Girl I only want ten minutes in this rented truck
Got them windows foggin' hazy baby
Wildin' I'm an eighties baby
Super mookin' fiend we found nirvana like that naked baby
Danica Patrick way she strip this chick is racy
Girl yo ass is crazy if you think I'm wifin' you
This some shit I'd write for you

She hit that pole in my basement she rollin' she wasted
She face bout an eighth of that space shit and went ape shit
Don't pace it don't chase it
That's straight lick it burn slow
She role play my teacher and I can't wait to learn nigga
I role play big turn up Obey that's G shit
We smoking Js of that juicy fruit that Juicy J that three-six
White T's first class flights and Nike kicks believe this
Waves on tsunami she likely get seasick
I red tail that fly boy Michael Phelp in the cloud boy
In the sea of that loud boy altitude is all altoids
Fresh bitch like breath mints
Whilin up in the section
The monkey's roll and that kush to go
Bottles up in this section
 
She dolled up I'm soda
Red cup that I hold up
Break the milk but wait hold up
Fuck I do with my roll up
I want this shit and I want you too
I know this shit sound cynical
But can I skip the skit and get into you 
Baby can you strip and get in the pool 
Life is so yummy when your problems taste like honey
Every day so sunny when I'm pound cakin this money
2 hands on full grip take this shit to the bank
She said boy you takin my breath away
Girl get a oxygen tank
Damn caught you fallin but my feet were out of bounds
Sooner or later you gon reach some solid ground
Who the fuck said chilvery dead 
Girl why you quit givin me head 
Makin me call Lewinski
You fuckin up like Hilary did

I know that I belongs to you
I wonder if I'll ever be found
Caught between the life and the lights and uh
Oh maybe we can figure this out
I figure it's ahead of where the crown I found
The hardest form of troublesome
'Cause we always come undone yea we always
Yea we always
I had a 5 year plan
But in twenty-four months bitch I got it all done
Twenty-four blunts of the skunk toast the glass to winners
Drinking 'til I vomit scallops I guess that was dinner
I'm blown got my shades on
But it's funny right 'cause this life
Never been this bright
Don't be foolish boy it's always more to it
Stuck between a rock and a boiling pot
Lead a whole block leading all for doctors
What you on I'mma put us on
I ain't talkin' pebbles when I tell em that I'm stoned
Oh so fade bitch I'm oh so faded
Shine like my life gold plated
Hungry like it's Budapest Shawty who da best 
Roll the mook let me do the rest yeah

Ride around on volks holler at my folks
Got a lot of smoke pockets on halitos'
Stinky green stinky green let me set the scene
Flee the scene and my weapon clean fiend

That's my story and I'm sticking to it

This ain't Amsterdam but we go Dutch
Trick you could pay for your own lunch
You clearly have the wrong one
I mean you clearly must be on one un uh
You wanna see me lately see me when it's all done
Sorry hun it was all fun um
Living out my dreams I don't need to sleep
Going offroad I don't need a Jeep
I'm a leader sky beaming I seen it had a vision
Purple drapes high ceilings purple haze high ceilings
I just keep on getting better I amaze high ceilings
I Never cap like the snapple fact matter fact
Make em double back every fuckin' track
Here kitty catacomb dead to me
Breakfast in bed honeycombs and some head for me
Put me in a song what she said to me

Ride around on volks holler at my folks
Got a lot of smoke pockets on halitos'
Stinky green sticky green let me set the scene
Flee the scene and my weapon clean fiend

That's my story and I'm sticking to it

Another day another flight
Another city what a fuckin' night
Damn baby drop that ass twerk it right
Fifteen stamps in a month that was somethin' light
Like work like way
Life's good scratch that life' great
She's cool got that nice cake
Thanksgiving plate baby I'll scrape
Thicker than a snicker fuck it i'll wait
She said her date so out dated
They say nothin' is free but she do it for me
Shorty poppin' some E then she poppin' for me
And she rollin'. Yea she rollin'
Them niggas with me Yea my niggas believe
Everything that we need they gon get it through me
And we rollin'. Yea we rollin'
Why you niggas trippin' like you licking toads
On another level and them bitches know
So niggas want my seat I'm like that's a rope
Kill the noise bitch I'm a professional
She know it's comin' I'm the next to blow
Got her signin' all the fuckin' checks with an axonal
All I do is look yea my shit is exceptional
You slippin' boy you f'in low
I'm shinin' got fluorescent glow
Nigga climb up to my pedestal
You was lookin' good right here never muckin' boo ras
Smokin' good around here
Late day three sixty-five that's a round year
My trip sixteen zips that's a pound there
My chick fantastic bust it down there
Her lips so thick yea they pucker down there
They say nothin' is free but she do it for me
Shorty poppin' some E then she poppin' for me

I'm the maestro you up in the stands
You should clap your hands when I orchestrate
Running ice so put it in my hands
I'll take you to the land that the coaches pray for
Dreamville my team so ill that all make heat and we all get paid for it
Rock stages and back stage it was your dream girl she gone wait for us
Two years ago Cole told me bro you gonna blow just wait for it
So I hone my craft wasn't a forward of cash
Put my heart of wax I was made for it
Then I wrote a track and he fucked with that
And we shot a vid and he paid for it
It's that organic me and rappers me and them not the same story
I traveled the atlas before I was rapping
The king was what my parents raised for
Lost in the traffic but my city 
Started trap just to pay for it
A pair of new kicks hoes stay at my wrist
Didn't impress all them chicks that I craved for
Now I don't even need to say shit
Bitch need I say more  
This my personal life this a personal right
You can turn from the light then shine on niggas like a baby at birth
Just peeped this first bit of life

Can't block it where the E clips 
I'm too kush for you I'm too kush for you

Smoke dank nigga glowin' in the dark
Miss calls like I don't wanna talk
All these snake ass niggas in the grass man
Thinkin' all these dog ass hoes wanna bark
All that talk'll make a nigga leave

It's gettin' late I'm thinkin' hit the beach girl
Get naked you can take a leap here
Let's be clear real nigga shit

Every day a nigga cold now I froze now
I'm torn down whoa no
Not lookin' for a hold down to slow down just go down low
Got some money I can thrown down
We can go a couple more rounds
We can do it with the roof up but I'm 'bout to make it pour down
I'm throwed now like third down and 17 Super Mookin Fiends
You know the team carry I got my city on Brooklyn to Queens
They was lookin' for more till they looked into me
I just got in and out niggas done had it for a minute man
Why they still lookin' like rookies to me
I've been committed and all my nigga tryna make a million
Give you my opinion
Fuck with the team I found a bean in my pocket wooh
Might pop it in a bit and left came back God damn i'm poppin' in this bitch
Still all these bitches get is stick from me
RIP that nigga Chivalry
Shout out God to my nigga Shigitty dawg
Will week nigga every minute we ball
Get it regardless
Fucking the game I hit it the hardest
It won't be the same I give you my word
I never do promises unless I deliver
Life's a bitch but ain't no living unless I forgive her
That's bottles after bottles all this stress on my liver
I don't ever watch the news
They don't ever do no articles about the stress on my niggas
We the best in the business I'm their Captain-Lieutenant
Cole he caught a jet and rolled
He just point ahead to roll niggas slept for a minute
Now its over for these hoes claimed the city for my own
Listen when the story told they gone tear they gone cheer

Pass it pass it now I'm blasted
Ash it ash it stupid bastard
My eyes lower than a casket
My piff greener than the Packers
My chicks meaner then the ratchet
My hydro I call it drastic
That's that shit have a nigga on a trip
Get a grip counter grip
Grab a bitch pound a bitch
Hittin' licks pounds of piff
I don't ever feel these rapper I can tell they counterfeit
Hop up on the mountain pits

And them hoes they know
The Feinds is mooking by the O's
Burn and stick it light the flame
Super mook glad you came

Mooking haze everyday face
Slid up on a base safe
Sorry copper I don't take the bait snake
I just move the weight cake
While I'm out of state I go on a date
Then I will penetrate I don't make mistakes
Feel I'm 'bout to break I let her decide my fate
She treat me like a shake weight wait
Count money burn celebratory blunts
Gotta get it 'cause you only gonna live it once
Tryna own it I ain't fuckin' with the rented ones
Jamaica Queens but I take it where it's really from
The sentence of the kush ascended from the kush
All you mook hoes do a bear shit in the woods

And them hoes they know
The Feinds is mooking by the O's
Burn and stick it light the flame
Super mook glad you came hoes
That's it that's it now I'm blasted

They wanna cage you in a wood box
Tell you money make the world stop
I wish the motherfuckers would stop
I wish I coulda went to Woodstock
Whole clique piff flame
Make a broke nigga feel like a rich man
Like a rich man like a rich man
They wanna cage you in a wood box
Tell you money make the world stop
I wish the motherfuckers would stop
I wish I coulda went to Woodstock
Whole clique piff flame
Make a broke nigga feel like a rich man
Like a rich man like a rich man
I'm super mook

And them hoes they know
The Feinds is mooking by the O's
Burn and stick it light the flame
Super mook glad you came

A thousand dollars on one drink later
That bottle from my niggas
Drop knowledge on these hoes
Coke bottle from the figure
Top model when she pose
Bird brain always talking so what's so
Give a fuck about your past please be more current
Try to make waves you gone need more current
You should get you one of these
Heart bigger than a picture couldn't fit it on my sleeve
Hard regale got check couldn't get me on my knees
Hard liquor good sex couldn't get you bitch to leave
Damn I never said I'm the greatest but I only get greater
Sixty cities off six teens just half for you later
I just laugh on my haters you gonna have to excuse
You gone need a jujitsu to cut through half of my layers
I am like the rap Himalayas you can die at the peak
It's such a beautiful sky

You would die for a peak
I always saw it on a bigger scale than the most niggas
I try tell 'em but you can't tell most niggas
Since I've been high I could always see high
Like a bee hive buzzing did it whip my nigga
Really we like cousins annd if you see life frontin'
Gun it and chase that bitch but when you take that risk
It's a double xord my nigga hit the feds while he had to make that flip
I put the paper to lyrics make sure my crew full
That something useful
Make sure you make it the fruit fall
You want eat as much shit as you choose to

Shout out to by nigga Ron Gilmore
Nigga was like you need to rap on this beat
So I was like you know I'm going to rap on this beat

Listen up I'm gone like ET
No prone alloy all white GT
Waking up early morning not easy
Bas is a fiend snort 'til at least 3
Coming up watch me peak
White home with a loan this not DC but I be the president
Run the confederate of the generous
Well bitches never sell a bit
Trying to get in my city better sell a bit
Sell a bit sell 'Piff nigga sell a brick
Sell tricks up make your stretch boy
New Jigster that's my next toy
Going like Wall Street after exploits
Off that bomb weed that I explore
Calmly board the next plane at the airport
Where I'm going Who knows
Anywhere it ain't snowing with two hoes
Penthouse condo with two floors
Dipping through minor coke and two doors
New ports shit they ain't hotter than me
Kick up my feet like an G'
Wake up my bed makes itself
Bake up inhale take deep breath

So high I can never find a fucking thing
But I always find my fucking bling
Riding on the rings
Saturn swagger got me all rapping out of pattern
Smoking good give your bitch wood like a tavern
If they could bet them niggas would
Doesn't matter 'cause they can't serve them hoes
They ain't on a platter took my bank
Eminem nigga Marshall Mathers
That's a couple milli' hoe stuntin' like a video
Burning on the piccolo green
New York City Fiend
City colder than the ghoster
Streets like a cobra until you get bitten you probably wouldn't even know what I mean
They ask but they never know what I seen
So busy trying to scheme a nigga forgot to dream
I'm dreamin' lucid
Chess not checkers ya'll niggas stupid
Bet's not check 'cause ya'll niggas foolish
Bas serve 'em hot ya'll at the 
Damn revenge is a dish best served cold
So I wish that to them assholes
Yeah wave goodbye to my last goals
Set sight on the flag poles
My nigga just roll one let the storm settle
Feel like a lightning storm and I'm on metal
Feel like this life is a long walk thru nights to long coats with knives and nigga we all cattle
Crabs in a bucket this is a small barrel
Magnum blast yo ass with a long barrel
Boy meet the devil
Tell him come off you apparel
For that pearly white ice your life is in peril
The needle ain't sterile
The wound is infected
Broke as a joke
So the wounded neglected
This ain't a joke tho it's foolish to mess with a man on the edge
Shit that's just a death wish
You in some shit now
Float in the septic
Pitch em your goals but the throw intercepted
Your niggas is grimey
Your ho is deceptive
Highway to life and theres only one exit
But fuck it I veer off a road that is less followed  
The orchestra led and the guests followed
The trumpets blow leave your chest hollow
Violins play your sins on the strings and it sing it go

How come everywhere I go I see a liquor store 
How come that nigga a vet but yet that nigga broke 
How come a nigga gotta die for you remember me 
How come the middle of July feel like Decemeber 
See the summer time is killing season
Kiss my momma every day boy I'm barely breathing
Bunch of heathens round me rather see me under cement
Paranoia but this mook will keep me off the deep end
So much beef in these city streets
I pray you go vegan
War torn from war stories man where do we begin
Niggas is carbon dioxide just waitin to seep in
While you sleepin leave your brain matter splattered and leaking
Find a pastor a deacon rabbi or imam
Tryna fly my way to heaven but this turbulence is strong
My momma taught me right
My city taught me wrong
They say I'm on my way
I pray it won't be long
Need sunshine leave the city unwind
Shine so hard God the city leave son blind
The city is unkind
The city get no sleep
I rummage her underworld
The city is so deep
And it preach

Haters form like ice after winter storms
Never play along bag a chick girl let's make a porn
Make a sandwich bitch
Make a marriage strip go south like you on a van with
Split like the grams me and my man get gotta feed the fam understand this
8 balls underhand pitch snitch crawl under sand ditch
Paint a perfect picture would you be my canvas my name is in the scripture my makin' to plan this
I planned it outstanding good things come to those who wait
But hey I want that cake right now take a bitch on a sober date
What I look like hit the gate and board a flight cloud it formed
You are now in the right crowd when you hear that weak shit tell them niggas pipe down
Fiend bitch get her beak wet mirror wipe down
She show me the secrets she'll show you the night gown Husband slash life clown
Like Drake bitch Thank me Later New York Yankee fuck you hater
Big crib mad trees don't see my neighbor just see that paper
Yeah she's a stand up chick but shit I layed her I layed her yeah she's a stand up chick but shit I layed her I layed her

I thank god for the blizzard we snowed in
Girl you lookin' like you rode in on a piff cloud
Was it frozen and where the piff now are you holdin' 
'Cause I damn sure is lil' mama newsflash this shit potent
Lil' mama leave ya baggage at the door please check yo shit
'Cause that's yo biz lil' mama me and you
Well we here for another reason
It's December but i'm feelin' like another season
'Cause the flowers in June gon' sing a love tune
And a howl at the moon tell her bring ya love soon
Sharper than a harpoon yeah shorty wetter than a monsoon
Yeah I read your colors like a cartoon
But this purple say we depart soon gone

Can we take a little trip 
We'll be gone couple hours
We don't need a private jet
Shorty get up on this dower

You take me high like a seaside tidal wave
Final days we spend 'em confined inside a cave
With a moat of Hennessy marijuana blaze
Liquor flowin' in the sleet whole 'lotta haze
Whole 'lotta chicks wanna take ya place though
You the only one I could never replace though
They might replicate yo style
Can't replicate yo smile you on hold
Ain't no doubt could you wait here for a while 
Could you be the one that's always gon' look out for me 
See them birds on my arm and know it's falconry
'Cause you elevate me higher than a balcony
But when you high girl you always start to doubtin' me
Why I know that kush is paranoia
Type of shit to make 'em look and think they never saw ya
I ain't toyin' wit ya girl I'm tryna tell ya
I'll be ya Ray Liotta now that's a good fella

Can we take a little trip 
We'll be gone couple hours
We don't need a private jet
Shorty get up on this dower

We super mooked high I look in ya eyes
And ask you if you down to take a ride yeah
Stroll up on a prairie house and steal the pie from 'em
No need to roll another one 'cause you a fly woman
Kind woman divine woman
But if you disrespect Genghis Khan woman
I'm pullin' for you 'cause you marathon runnin'
Life is so cruel you had better times honey but
It's always stormy before the beautiful day
And sometimes you corny in the cutest of ways
And a bit annoying 'cause you blew all my haze but it's cool
Now you horny 'cause you blew all my haze
Got me in a daze girl yeah 'cause ya strength make me brave girl
Take a gaze I know it's dark but me and you 
Could never get estranged world

Can we take a little trip 
We'll be gone couple hours
We don't need a private jet
Shorty get up on this dower
Yo I got slugs for snitches no love for bitches
Puttin' thugs in ditches when my trigger finger itches
I got a rep that make police jet known to get a priest wet
I never beg for pussy like Keith Sweat
Is Big L slow Hell no 
Bitches get fucked on the roof when I ain't got no hotel dough 
I'm known for yokin' Japs
And beatin' them with smokin' gats
Leavin' token Blacks with broken backs and open caps
So with that bullshit step to the rear son
The last thing you want with Big L is a fair one
'Cause in a street brawl I strike men like lightnin'
You seen what happened in my last fight friend Aight then
I beat kids with lead pipes I leave trails of dead mic's
Where I'm from niggas jewels get ran like red lights
Old folks get mugged and raided crimes are drug-related
And we live by the street rules that thugs created
Clowns get smoked about a thousand folks
Sellin' pounds of coke
Front in this town and get a Tec-9 stuck down your throat
I'm tellin' you shit is about to get drastic soon
I'm quick to blast a goon
And break a mothafucker like a plastic spoon
I got the looks that make your hottie stare
I keep a shotty near
It's that nigga with notty hair who Gotti fear
Tracks I'm known to roast until the microphone is ghost
Props I own the most I'm leavin' niggas comatose
Front and get your brain pinched
Big L will have your whole gang lynched
I started smokin' dust and been insane since
This rap shit was a great gift
The other night some snake riffed and got a hot lead facelift
All through high school I had braids I kept mad blades
Stabbin' teachers to death that gave me bad grades
I cook the mic like a beef steak 'cause my technique's great
And I'm the nigga police hate in each state
'Cause I'm the neighborhood lamper
Punk brother vamper fuck around
You'll find my silk boxers in your mother's hamper
Cops drop when my Glock makes a pow sound
I'm from a wild town
You know my style clown so bow down 

Brothers can beg and borrow still feel sorrow
When Jay Z like Zorro get in that ass better luck tomorrow
I'm too much nigga so never should you rush
You need slow down or get yo' ass tore down
Check it out I'm too cocky to stop me you gotta kill me
And when I'm gone you can still feel me on the real B
The shit is eternal I rock the heavens well
Even if they won't let me in Heaven I raise hell
'Til it's Heaven recognize the black cat with the nine lives
Get up off me nigga it's bad luck to cross me
I'm poppin' Crystal shootin' game like missiles
As projected all hoes affected by this style
I mack like Goldie go back like the oldie
But the goody pullin' pop bitches wearin' hoodies
They don't be knowin' the way I be flowin'
When I be goin' I be runnin' the track like Jesse Owens
I disrupt the natural scheme
The way that you do things with a swing
And have 'em rockin' like
You say never you run if ever you come
It's never you run so fast in your life to never have won
Come on and ride the rhythm I produce like jizm
Just like the gods I start with knowledge
And follow with wisdom
For greater understandin' I'm landin' blows
And knockin' sense into those that oppose me
Enticin' when slicin' through tracks
You're screamin' Jesus Christ he's back
And God knows he can rap
Me and L put rhythm on the map so give him his dap
And me I just take mine
Gimme those gimme this gimme that
You never see me stressed in a Mercedes
On the prize my greedy eyes can't see no less
Jigga incredible even my thoughts is federal
Like kidnapping extortion and corruption
So you know beatin' me will never come
Like a nun or tomorrow I'm too thorough nigga
I make moves 'cause bowels to move
When I'm creepin' through your way
With a thousand little dudes
Armed with a piece like Islam
I make your eyes rise like yeast
Surprise I feel no fear when facing y'all
Bet your lyrics jump off the track like racing cars
Emcee's tryin' to be the best
And even in dyin' couldn't be this def
I see no reason to stop cheesin'
And we can get down and split the wealth
That's when I found I could do it myself I get up

Ayo my crew be deliverin' hot lead when gats are clenched
Rappers I jack and lynch nobody can fuck with the way
I be killin' them shits in rap events
Big L is the nigga you expect
To catch wreck on any cassette deck
I'm so ahead of my time my parents haven't met yet
I'm feelin' like Billy Bathgate
My rap style is past great
I love to fuck a bitch from the back and watch her ass shake
I probly got your mommy strung
Niggas hear me and take more notes than Connie Chung
My clan plans to get Giuliani hung
Never had a gassed head got loot 'cause I stash bread
Try to tax and I'ma beat your faggot-ass half-dead
I stomp white cops 'til they life stops for a low price hops
'Cause my blood is colder than an ice box
'Cause my crew'll kill a nigga from the lobby to the top floor
And every time my Mac-11 bucks
I'm killin' at least seven ducks
I never was a follower of Reverend Butts
The bitch type I dislike I'm rougher than a fist fight
All chicks ain't shit ain't no such thing as Ms. Right
So we can never be a couple hun
Fuck love All I got for hoes is hard dick and bubble gum
And clown MC's I be attackin' quick
I'm on some rappin' shit and some car-jackin' shit
I ran up on this nigga name Mac in a black Ac'
And put the gat to his cap click-clack
Sorry Jack but get up out of that 
My nine works great so make a mistake and hesitate
I can't wait to demonstrate this nickel plate
He didn't listen to what I was speakin' he started reachin'
So I left him sleepin' with his temple leakin'

As soon as I grab it I eat it up like a savage
And no I don't have it
I get it together like a marriage
I'm seekin' all rappers I'm on my P's and Q's and carrots
Y'all don't understand well
Goddamn don't you know my status 
I'm flowin' the fattest
No need to explain my name the only thing that matters
For suckers who bite me they find I'm a bit much to swallow
You're thinkin' that's hollow
The rhythm is too rrugged to follow
Let me take a little breath goddamn
The kid is a wizard
I'm definitely destined to make eight digits
Met up with L on the road to riches
As soon as I step up nah whenever I'm in the
Uh whatever I touch whatever I clutch
You know I'm gonna end ya
Uh the nigga don't play hey the nigga don't play hey
What you niggas gonna do to the man
I see you brought your little crew and 
I'm still comin' with velocity
Ain't none of these clowns standin' their ground
With the crown prince of the underground
Sounds like I'm ready to catch wreck now
The heats on sweat now
Jay-Z's on be gone to the next town
Punk jump up and get beat down
Check it out check it out check it out
Ladies be comin' out of their seats now
Shit I got crazy skills it's a pity the way I'm rippin'
Rugged rhythm through the city
I got rhythm I hit 'em with rhythm I
Hit 'em and split 'em I did 'em I get rid of them guys
Baby  with crazy ease watch Jay-Z get crazy G's

Ayo you better flee hops or get your head flown three blocks
L keep rappers' hearts pumpin' like Reeboks
And every year I gain clout and my name sprouts
Some brothers'd still be virgins if the crack never came out
I got the wild style always been a foul child
I'm known to have a hottie open
I keep the shotty smokin'
Front and get half the bones in your body broken
And when it comes to gettin' nookie I'm not a rookie
I got girls that make that chick Toni Braxton look like Whoopi
I run with sturdy cliques
I'm never hittin' dirty chicks
Got thirty-five bodies buddy don't make it thirty-six
Step to this you're good as gone
Word is bond I leave mics torn when I put it on

Nobody can take nothin' from Big L but a loss chief
The last punk who fronted got a mouth full of false teeth
I'm known to gas a hottie and blast a shotty
Got more cash than Gotti you better ask somebody
Big L is a crazy brother and I'm a lady lover
A smooth kid that'll run up in your baby mother
I push a slick Benz I'm known to hit skins
And get ends and commit sins with sick friends
'Cause I'm a money getter also a honey hitter
You think you nice as me Haha you's a funny nigga
I flows so one of my shows wouldn't be clever to miss
I'm leavin' competitors pissed
To tell you the truth it gets no better than this
I'm catchin' wreck to the break of dawn
In this song yo it's a must that I put it on

Some boys see me gun nozzle and take a we fi joke
Boy you gwan dead before you see me gun smoke
See me gun nozzle and take me fi joke
You gwan dead from a me you provoke

I drink Moët not Beck's beer I stay dressed in slick gear
Peace to my homies in the gangsta lean I see you when I get there
And it's a fact I keep a gat in my arm reach
I charm freaks and bomb geeks from here to Palm Beach
I'm puttin' rappers in the wheelchair
Big L is the villain you still fear
'Cause I be hangin' in Harlem and shit is for real here
If you battle L you picked the wrong head
I smash mics like cornbread
You can't kill me I was born dead
And I'm known to pull steel trigs and kill pigs
I run with ill kids and real nigs who peel wigs
My rap's steady slammin' I keep a heavy cannon
It's a new sheriff in town and it ain't Reggie Hammond
Peace to my peoples the Children of the Corn
'Cause we put it on adios ghost I'm gone

Fuck all the glamours and glitz I plan to get rich
I'm from New York and never was a fan of the Knicks
And I'm all about expanding my chips
You mad 'cause I was in the van with your bitch
With both hands on her tits
Corleone hold the throne that you know in your heart
I got style plus the way that I be flowing is sharp
A while back I used to hustle selling blow in the park
Counting G stacks and rocking ice that glow in the dark
Forever hottie hunting trigger temper I'm quick to body something
You looking at me like I'm probably fronting
I fuck around and throw three in your chest and flee to my rest
I'm older and smarter this is me at my best
I stopped hanging around y'all 'cause niggas like you
Be praying on my downfall hoping I flop
Hoping I stop you probably even hope I get locked
Or be on the street corner with a pipe smoking the rock
I got more riches than you fuck more bitches than you
Only thing I haven't got is more stitches than you
Fucking punk you ain't a leader what nobody followed you
You was never shit your mother should have swallowed you
You on some tag-along flunky yes man shit
Do me a favor please get off the next man dick
And if you think I can't fuck with whoever put your money up
Put your jewels up no fuck it put your honey up
Put your raggedy house up nigga or shut your mouth up
Before I buck lead and make a lot of blood shed
Turn your tux red I'm far from broke got enough bread
And mad hoes ask Beavis I get nothing Butthead
My game is vicious and cruel fucking chicks is a rule
If my girl think I'm loyal then that bitch is a fool
How come You can listen to my first album
And tell where a lot of niggas got they whole style from
So what you acting for 
You ain't half as raw you need to practice more
Somebody tell this nigga something before I crack his jaw
You running with boys I'm running with men
I'ma be ripping the mics until I'm a hundred and ten
I throw slugs at idiots no love for city cops
I sport a pretty watch eight-hundred and fifty rocks
I'm making wonderful figures
I don't fuck with none of you niggas
I might pull out this gun on your niggas
And rob every last one of you niggas

Aight let me kick some more shit one more time
Aight check it out yeah check it out
Yeah check it out yeah check it out
Uhh check it out aight check it out
Aight we gone hit it like this check it out
Yo check it yo my shit is hot like jerk chicken
I should rob you but with that cheap shit you ain't worth stickin'
I've got a left hook that be leaving guys knocked out
Keep fronting and I'ma choke you till your eyes pop out
I was taught that if a nigga swing you have to  swing right back
Battle Corleone why do a stupid thing like that
Yo I'm not in the mood son so don't push me tonight
Plus I fucked your little sister and that pussy was right
That pussy was tight gripping my dick like a pair of pliers
You fucking snitch right now you prolly wearing wires
It's not a joke so as soon as he laugh
I'ma strip him naked and stick a long broom in his ass
Leave him heart-broken make him quit rap and start smokin'
My album is done so no there ain't no parts open
I'm not a sweet stud I'm a street thug
That's quick to beat a nigga like a cheap rug till he leak blood
You sure soft watched you fall off might slide your whore off
Then call all off and tear your jaw off
My life is far out I got star clout
Every week bring a different car out
Go to clubs and buy the bar out
You ain't a player put that cigar out
Take that suit off before I shoot off and tear your roof off
Leave your clothes bloody-red like the nose of Rudolph
I rocked many stages and never got booed off
I might let this gat burst put you in a big black hearse
For that wack verse should have tried these other cats first
'Cause none of y'all niggas can fuck with me
And if your man wanna join I got McGruff with me
We puff much izzy
I do shit that only tough men do
And them cats you with fuck them too I'll buck them too
You got fucked upstate you cupcake
How many dicks can your butt take
I ran through every bitch in my path
I was fuckin' chicks in the ass when I was six-and-a-half
Yo I'm a take you out your misery
And after this nigga put you in the social study book 'cause you're history

Follow me tell me if you feel me
I think niggas is tryin' to kill me
Picturin' pistols spittin' hollow points till they drill me
Keepin' it real and even if I do conceal
My criminal thoughts preoccupied with keepin' steel
See niggas is false sittin' in court turned snitches
That used to be real but now they're petrified bitches
I'm tryin' to be strong they sendin' armies out to bomb me
Listen to Ron the only DJ that can calm me
Constantly armed my firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm and fuck the world till I'm gone
Bitches be warned word is bond you'll get torn
I'm bustin' on Giuliani he rubbin' my niggas wrong
And then it's on before I leave picture me
I'm spittin' at punk bitches and hustlin' to be free
Watch me set it niggas don't want it you can get it
Bet it make these jealous niggas mad I said it
This Thug Life nigga we don't cater to you hoes
Fuck with me have a hundred motherfuckers at yo' do'

I'm hard Jehovah said I'm barred from the pearly gates
Fuck Him I didn't wanna go to heaven anyway
But my momma got me on my knees with my hands gripped
Hail Mary fuck her I never knew her
I'd probably screw her and dump her body in the sewer
Our father my pops stuck up dope spots big black and mean
With the fifth by the Gabardine
What you expected from his next of kin
I'm loco bro but ain't no Mexican
I got nines in the bedroom Glocks in the kitchen
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin'
The lesson from the Mac-10 is depressin'
Niggas keep stressin' the same motherfuckin' question
How many shots does it take to make my heart stop
And my body start to shake Ron G stop the break

I be that young pretty fly smooth glorious kid
A Bad Boy just like Notorious B.I.G
I'll Roc-a-Fella like Shawn Carter
With more game than Ron Harper
The bomb sparker rapper slash charm robber
While y'all be on the corners bummy and high
I be out buyin' the finest shit money can buy
You wish you was in a position that I'm in
Hot rhymin' diamonds shinin' autograph signin'
My lifestyle is far out
Every week bring a different car out
I go to nightclubs and buy the bar out
Uh 'cause I keep cream I'm large on the street scene
Every time I touch mics you hear all the freaks scream
That nigga who hold it down for Uptown

And listen real closely how I break this slang shit down

And if you got robbed you got stuck
If you got shot you got bucked
And if you got double-crossed you got fucked
And if you got punched that mean you got snuffed
A bull scare is a strong bluff
I know you like the way I'm freaking it
I talk with slang and I'mma never stop speaking it

That's just the way that I talk yo

Yo yo a burglary is a jook
Mobb Deep already explained the meanin' of shook
If you caught a felony you caught a F
If you got killed you got left
If you got the dragon you got bad breath
If you got AIDS you got the germ
If a chick gave you a disease then you got burned
I know you like the way I'm freaking it
I talk with slang and I'mma never stop speaking it

The iron horse is the train
And champagne is bubbly
A deuce is a honey that's ugly
If your girl is fine she's a dime
A suit is a vine
Jewelry is shine
If you in love that make you blind
Genuine is real
A face card is a hundred dollar bill
A very hard long stare is a grill
If you sneaking to go see a girl that mean you creeping
To guerrilla mean to use physical force
I talk with slang and I'mma never stop speaking it

Follow me tell me if you feel me
I think niggas is tryin' to kill me
Picturin' pistols spittin' hollow points 'til they drill me
Keepin' it real and even if I do conceal
My criminal thoughts preoccupied with keepin' steel
See niggas is false sittin' in court turned snitches
That used to be real but now they petrified bitches
I'm tryin' to be strong they sendin' armies out to bomb me
Listen to Ron the only DJ that can calm me
Constantly armed my firepower keep me warm
I'm trapped in the storm and fuck the world 'til I'm gone
Bitches be warned word is bond you'll get torn
I'm bustin' on Giuliani he rubbin' my niggas wrong
And then it's on before I leave picture me
I'm spittin' at punk bitches and hustlin' to be free
Watch me set it niggas don't want it you can get it
Bet it make these jealous niggas mad I said it
This thug life nigga we don't cater to you hoes
Fuck with me and have

I be that young pretty fly smooth glorious kid
I'll rock a fella like Shawn Carter
With more game than Ron Harper
The bomb sparker rapper slash armed robber
While y'all be on the corners bummy and high
I be out buyin' the finest shit money can buy
You wish you was in a position that I'm in
Hot rhymin' diamonds shinin' autograph signin'
My lifestyle is far out
Every week bring a different car out
I go to nightclubs and buy the bar out huh
'Cause I keep cream I'm large on the street scene
Every time I touch mics you hear all the freaks scream

That nigga who hold it down for Uptown
On this underground real shit nigga it's the heat nigga
Now rewind this motherfucker
You know you can't help it
Deadly combination bwoy 
It's the number one crew in the area

Gettin' men lynched and when tensed I'm killin' infants for ten cents
'Cause I'm a street genius with a unique penis
Got fly chicks on my dick that don't even speak English
I'm makin' ducks shed much tears I buck queers
I don't have it all upstairs but who the fuck cares 
I'm grabbin' brews takin' fast swiggas
I get cash and stash figures and harass them bitch ass niggas
After you your man'll get scarred next
And if your squad flex I'm lettin' off like Bernard Goetz
Fillin' niggas with so much lead they can use they dick for a pencil
I'm known for snatchin' purses and bombin' churches
I get more pussy by accident than most niggas get on purpose
I got drug spots from New York to Canada

Now it's the dictator who's style is greater
It's the man with more wild flavors than motherfuckin' now and laters
And rappers I hit 'em well
They automatically go to heaven fuckin' with me 'cause I give 'em hell
So don't try to front troop
When your style is played out just like an Oshkosh jumpsuit
I'm out to collect figures
I'm on some Wu-Tang shit so protect your fucking neck nigga
Not a role model I'm a bad figure
When it comes to rap I got skills out the ass nigga
I got it locked like a warden
Rap without Finesse is like the NBA without Jordan
So all ya new jacks kickin' wack raps
It's a fact that I'll be on your fuckin' back like a knapsack
It ain't shit you can tell me
Because bitches still gel me without a motherfuckin' LP

It's the number one crew in the area

Yo I got a death wish
That's why I talk so much fuckin' shit
I want these bitch motherfuckers to try to flip
So I can fill up this clip
And stick the gun between they lips like a cigarette
And let 'em smoke the four fifth
Ah fool ah goodbye no need to try to lie or cry
It's time for motherfuckers to die
Because to me death is like sex
And if my brain was a deck of cards I'd be missing a whole deck
Strap up a Mac and motherfuckers are runnin' like rats
The blind bats are fuckin' crazed cats
'Cause the Microphone Nut's loose
And you're wonderin' how the fuck did this madman get cut loose
From twenty-five consecutive twenty-five to life bids
For murderin' up some fuckin' white kids
These were the kids of the prison guards
Then I startin' killin' squads of prison guards in the prison yard
One two everybody's through
The Microphone Nut flew over the prison walls without a clue
And now I'm back to haunt shit and talk shit
Whoever flaunt shit I leave 'em unconscious
I run through ya with a maneuver and German luger
Please show me where the crack is at
While they quarter crack the sack I crack they backs like Cracker Jacks
So I'm the one you should run from
Because the Microphone Nut is like a motherfuckin' stun gun

The way I rock no way you could stop
I shock pop and drop when Jay gets hot
When I'm in the zone better hold ya own
'Cause I like to break when I finish a poem
No way you can get up when I get down
I shake rattle and roll and wreck shit like none
And beat a nigga ass half silly on the one
Fuckin' A fuckin' Jay ill with skill
So ladies step up I get around like a wheel
I'm never chokin' off chronic skills are bionic
Bitches are screaming like Onyx
Respect that I'll peel a punks cap back and sign it
Creep through your block fuck a Glock I step
Through your neighborhood armed with nothing but a rep
I'm giving these ladies something they can feel 'cause I'm real

It's the number one crew in the area
Known for sendin' garbage MCs to the graveyard

Yo you step up and you'll get played like the small fry
I'm throwin' niggas off the roof said you wanna be the Fall Guy
So mess around you'll be a dead man
I get hype tonight's the night like Redman
Nuff respect to Big L who get wreck
Chiggidy check yourself 'cause I ain't workin' with a full deck
I'm lethal eatin' people
Not Jeffery Dahmer I'm the sequel head or gut like Illegal
I'm leavin' caps in your back fool
I rip tracks wanna say peace to hip hop
A nigga disagree bring it on and get dropped
I get wreck I'm Party Arty so hit the deck
The kid with the Tec smokin' niggas like cigarettes
Now some ask me how I'm gettin' jewels
I say big up big up it's a stick up stick up

Nigga we ghost man a punk
I let it roast and leave your pussy ass comatose
I'm shootin' up like the west is
Fuck suggestions
I'll blow out a niggas intestines
Better dip fast quick fast or you won't last
One blast will put your ass in a body cast
And I be killin' for rep get ill in a sec
Nine mil on your neck blood spill is still in effect
Constantly comittin' grand larceny
Arsony niggas don't want no parts of me
Never past up a fast buck ask the last duck
His jewels was truck he got his ass stuck
So what the fuck is you sayin' hops 
I'm wanted for slayin' cops
Who's ever around when I be sprayin' drops
But I ain't givin' a fuck who gets hit
Niggas coppin' pleas but I ain't tryin' to hear shit
I'll burn you faggot niggas like toast
If you die and come back I shoot your spirit
Now your ass is just a holy ghost
You tried to play me to the left
You better put a target on your head
'Cause you're marked for death

The microphone is through when this rap legend grab it
Sendin' poems to have them faggots
Diggin' hoes like Reverend Swaggart
L's the nigga that crime follows
I'm hittin' fine models and stabbin' punks with broken wine bottles
I beat chumps 'til they head splits
Then break 'em like bread sticks
I sex chicks I'll even fuck a dead bitch
Always sprayin' with my nine because I be stayin' vexed
Some nigga named Dex was in the projects layin' threats
I jumped out the Lincoln left him stinkin'
Put his brains in the street
Now you can see what he was just thinkin'
I'm chokin' enemies 'til they start turnin' pale
Satan said I'm learnin' well Big L's gonna burn in Hell
Front and get scarred 'cause your rap style ain't even hard
I run with a heathen squad and none of us believe in God

I got styles you can't copy bitch
Every Sunday a nun lay from my gun spray
Fuck Carlito we doin' shit the Devil Son's way
Every minute my style switches up
They said a real man won't hit a girl
Well I ain't real 'cause I beat bitches up
I use words that's ill L got nerves of steel
I'm cool but every now and then I get a urge to kill
I'm takin lives for a great price
I'm the type to snap in Heaven with a Mac-11 and rape Christ
And I'm fast to put a cap in a fag chest
The Big L's mad stressed 'cause Hell is my address
I'm on some satanic shit strictly
Little kids be wakin' up cryin'

No bitch I'm off duty
I'm breakin' hottie hearts niggas drop when my shotty sparks
It ain't no food in my fridge just body parts
I keep the gear fresh I keep the braids rugged
I never wear rubbers bitch if I get AIDS fuck it
A beef with me you better prevent it 'cause in a minute
I'll jump out a tinted rented and leave a nigga body dented
And my swoll knob your main girl cold-slobbed
And gave a blow job to my whole mob with no prob'
Ayo crazy bitches slept with L
Then they niggas got mad and tried to step to L
But I'm sicker than a nigga that's in special ed
So I suggest you spread pretzelhead
'Fore I turn your white sweatsuit red

Where no man can withstand or hold his own
Ayo spark up the phillies and pass the stout
Make it quick money grip or your ass is out
In a street brawl I strike men quicker than lightning
You seen what happened in my last fight friend a'ight then
L's a clever threat a lyricist who never sweat
Comparing yourself to me is like a Benz to a Chevrolette
And clown rappers I'm bound to slay
I'm saying hi to all the cuties from around the way
Yeah 'cause I got all of them sprung Jack
My girls are like boomerangs
No matter how far I throw them they come back
I'm coming straight out the New-York City
I'm down with Diggin In The Crates and I'm MVP

Yo it's a must that I get papes
Peace to all the DJ's who gave me love on they mixtapes
And once again the man's back with a dance track
So here's your chance Jack to get loose and let your hands clap
I got juice like Boku mad crews I broke through
Brothers be mad 'cause I hit more chicks than they spoke to
And everytime I'm jammed I always find a loophole
I got a crime record longer than Manute Bol
And my raps are unbelievable like aliens and flying saucers
No more iron horses 'cause I'm buying Porsches
Coming straight out the New-York City

Battles I lose none I make crews run
I get fools done got ten fingers but only use one
I run up like Machine Gun Kelly with a black skully
Put one in your belly leave you smelly then take your Pelle
I'm the neighborhood lamper punani vamper
Mess around you'll find my silk boxers in your Mommy's hamper
And nowadays girls want you for your money
I'm like Hev I got nothing but love for you honey
And since I'm looking slick and my pockets are thick
I need surgery to get chicks removed from my 

Yo once again it's the Big L that kid who got much props
From killin' corrupt cops with motherfuckin' buck shots
So don't step to this 'cause I got a live crew
You might be kinda big but they make coffins yo' size too
I was taught wise I'm known to extort guys
This ain't Califronia it's Harlem nigga we do walkbys
No one can match me tax me or wax me
If you want me to write you some raps G just ask me
'Cause on the shelf is where your LP cold stood
Because it was no good that shit ain't even go wood
I'm not the type to take sluts out I just fuck they guts out
Get my nuts out then break the fuck out
Me being a virgin that's idiotic
'Cause if Big L got the AIDS every cutie in the city got it
Once a nigga tried to stick me for six G's
And I put more holes in his ass than swiss cheese
 
Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black

I steal lives like a stone thief so leave me alone chief
Or catch a buck shot to your domepiece
I must warn I got it goin' on word is bond
Ducks be gettin' thrown off platforms like P.M. Dawn
I'm catchin' bodies like a villain's supposed to
And I squeeze triggers not just on niggas but hoes too
So don't try to test me 'cause I can't stand testers
Fuck around I'll introduce you to your ancestors
Step to this and get left with a face full of tears pal
But man you've been rappin' for years now
And ain't made a hit yet you flop in a split sec
In the shower's the only time you get your dick wet
I roll with scary crews I come out of wars barely bruised
I'm puttin' motherfuckers on the Daily News
I was a gangsta from the gitgo
Leavin' fags in bodybags with tags on they big toe

Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black

Yo ever since I was young I ripped mics and I killed beats
And I'm known to milk freaks and hit em on silk sheets
No dame can give me a bad name I got mad fame
I'm quick to put a slug in a fag brain
I be placin' snitches inside lakes and ditches
And if I catch AIDS then I'mma start rapin' bitches
I'm all about makin' papes kid
I killed my mother with a shovel just like Norman Bates did
My old man in the past stuck me up without a mask
Then his ass cold dashed with my cash fast
Fifty G's is what the creep stole so the next day
Knocked on his door and shot his granny through the peephole
That's the type of shit I'm on word is bond
Got it goin' on from the break of dawns to the early morn'
You know my style I'm wild comin' straight out of Harlem pal
It's Big L the motherfucking problem child

Or I'ma have your family dressed in all black

This goes out to all y'all bitchass niggas
So if your mother ain't ready for a funeral don't fuck with me
'Cause I know a good way to get your family together
And I ain't talkin' bout a reunion motherfucker
Yo I'm bout to sign out but before I go
I gotta say peace to the NFL crew you know who you are
And all y'all niggas talkin' that gun shit
And won't bust a rhyme stop fakin' the funk 
Word I'm bout to get up out of here
Yo I'm out B yo peace man
I gotta get this money
So all y'all niggas on my hitlist get your suits ready
Ayo Showbiz man I had this bugged out dream last night that I was the Devil's son B
I was doin' some ill shit

'Cause I'm the only son of the motherfuckin' Devil
It's a fact I'm livin' foul black
Niggas should have known I was sick
From the shit I did a while back
'Cause bein' bad I couldn't stop
When I was in preschool I beat a kid to death with a wooden block
Faggot niggas I was backslappin'
I realized that every time I got mad somethin' bad happened
A nigga hit me with a can of beer then he ran in fear
Later they found him hangin' from a chandelier
Enemies I be buckin' quick
My moms know who I am
'Cause she know who she was fuckin' with
When I catch fits my mom picks up the crucifix
And I kill chumps for the cheapest price
I'm rollin' with Satan not Jesus Christ
Enemies I got several done
I'm straight from hell the motherfuckin' Devil's son

When I was twelve I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus
I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns

It's Big L and I'm all about takin' funds
I'm a stone villain known for killin' and rapin' nuns
Ayo I even kill handicapped and crippled bitches
Look at my scalp real close and you'll see triple sixes
There's no doubt I'm all about a dollar
I just signed a lifetime contract with the funeral parlor
This kid that owed me dough I didn't take his life
Instead I tied him up and made him watch me rape his wife
One nigga cold tried to diss me and that shit is risky
The nigga took a swung but he missed me
So I popped off now the chump's knocked off
I spit in his mothafuckin' face and then bopped off
Once a hottie shot me with a shotty
I died but then I came back to life in another body
The way I'm livin' is dead wrong
I'm a devil from Hell without the tail or the red horns
Killin' is fun I'm number one with a gun
Front and get done 'cause you can't run from the Devil's Son

When I was twelve I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus
I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns

The Big L is strictly gun-play
I run through church and pistol-whip the priest every Sunday
Once I put out the crazy order
I sent niggas to kill Tom his mom and his baby daughter
I'm livin' up to my extortion image
I be stalkin' Lennox
Catchin' more bodies than abortion clinics
A kid tried to take L out
Shot me in the chest with a nine
I just laughed and spit the shell out
Next I took his gun then he dropped to his knees with ease
I made him freeze he begged me please not to squeeze
But I ain't the type to fuss I just snipe and bust
Click clack bang 
another nigga bites the dust
Shorts I'm takin' none
Misbehave and get sent to the grave by the Devil's Son

The motherfuckin' Devil's Son is definitely in effect
Givin' a shout-out to all the murderers thieves
Armed robbers serial killers psychos lunatics
Crackheads mental patients mental retards
And a special shout-out to all the niggas with AIDS

When I was twelve I went to hell for snuffin' Jesus
I'm wavin' automatic guns at nuns
They don't give a damn who gets killed
Just as long as the dice keep rollin
The hoes keep hoeing and the money keeps flowin

My name is L and I'm from a part of town where clowns
Get beat down and all you hear is gunshot sounds
And if you're soft don't go through it when it gets dark
'Cause at nighttime niggas try to tax
They're sneakier than alley cats
That's why I carry gats
Yo I'm a muthafuckin' fugitive
Buckwild and foul is the lifestyle that I choose to live
Because to me it's all about a buck
I used to have a partner in crime by the name of Chuck
We stormed the city shooting shit up like Frank Nitti
We robbed kids and split the dough fifty-fifty
One day we stuck a dice game on the avenue and split the cash
Then I murdered his ass and took his half
Because I'm all about ends and skins
When you got those you don't need no muthafuckin friends
If I catch you on a late night black you're getting stuck jack
My moms told me to get a job fuck that
Ayo picture me getting a job
Taking orders from Bob selling corn on the cob
Yo how the hell I'mma make ends meet
Making about a hundred dollars a week
Man I rather do another hit
I want clean clothes mean hoes and all that other shit
Yo I admit I'm a sucker
A low down dirty sneaky double-crossin connivin' muthafucka
Breaking in cribs with a crowbar
I used to wait until it gets dark
And tell a nigga to strip I wanna see some birthmarks
Like a ninja dressed in black with a ski mask
I take all the funds then I run down the street fast
I vicked this nigga named Eugene took his brand new ring
'Cause sticking up's an everyday routine
Once I was cruising in a beat-up ride
Saw this nigga named Clyde
And snuck up on him from the blind side
I told him give up the dough before you get smoked
Oh you're broke  now you're dead broke
The Big L was cold crazy
A top-notch crook snatching pocketbooks from old ladies
I don't care I'll do anything to get a buck
Even rob a Miller truck 'cause I don't give a fuck
Some say I'm ruthless some say I'm grim
Once a burglar broke into my house and I robbed him
Plenty and many brains I bust
'Cause I was livin' the lifestyle of the poor and dangerous
All of us from Harlem
That's living the lifestyle of the poor and dangerous
This goes out to my brothers
Whitey Ty Speeder Ru Dog Herb McGruff
E-Jet G Love Doc Ring Slice and Rich Dice
And I gotta say rest in peace to Mate the Skate Dog
And my man Kerry peace
Now what kinda life is that for a fucking child
Word to mother fuck all that stupid shit
Controversial not commercial nigga
Yo my crew is in the house
Terra Herb McGruff Buddah Bless
Big Twan Killa Cam Trooper J and Mike Boogie
And I'mma set it like this

Aiyo folks who quote what I wrote get choked
You better surrender before you get smoked
You niggas be thinkin this kid is a joke 
I put chumps to rest fast when my Smith-Weston blast
So just dash or trespass and get your chest smashed
Rap New York rules I sport jewels and extort crews
Don't get me pissed I got a short fuse
I go bezerk when I put in work or do dirt jerk
So stay alert no smirk 'cause these knuckles hurt
I'm from the alley not the valley
I'm hotter than Califronia wicked like Harry
And fuck Sally I rather marry Halle
I revive crowds with live styles
Don't hang with jive pals
Adios ghost I'm 5 thous'

Well I'm flave and I was down with the crime wave
Now it's time saved yo 'cause now I'm a rhyme slave
In the nineties I sold cracks collected some dough stacks
Hold gats a joker got his soul taxed
Innovated rappers you know who made it
Tell the Terra to rotate it his raps are gold-plated
This nigga Terra is past butter sharp like a glass cutter
Ass brother I leave your rhyme trash gutter
I'm more rare the MC in this warfare
Put you in a morgue where it's too late for that Lord prayer
Power struck Terra drops the follow-up
Sour luck niggas gotten props to swallow nuts

For those that don't know yo I'm Herb McGruff
I'm on some murder stuff and when I talk every verb is rough
Front on this and get beat bad
With big bats that bruise break bones then wind up bloody in a bodybag
MC's are live but I'm mad liver
Aiyo my rhymes are more funky than a African cab driver
Step to this and get sliced with ease ate up like rice and peas
Yo I'm nice with these
Ask the nigga in my last bout
He thought I just was on some gun shit I had to knock his ass out
Microphones I gotta tear
Peace to Big L straight from hell I'm the fuck up outta here

Aiyo it's time to get drastic but God bless the fantastic
Herb passed it now I melt the mic like it's plastic
I rag crews 'cause I'm bad news
In a mad mood I'm serving brothers quicker than fast food
Step to this and get your body blown
'Cause I'm no maricon for poems I slide the hotties home
Here's some advice I'm mad nice
Aiyo I'm quick to lick the mag twice and cold take a fag's life
My swellin melon got niggas jealin
Aiyo fuck bribes I'm takin niggas lives like a felon

Yo I bust chumps like a Glock when I drops in
The top ten is rocked when it's locked in
I just abuse the flow don't need a fuse to blow
Bruise the groove slow when I rhyme I just kill the show
I got lines that's deeper than a jail bid
Been no frail kids get nailed and read braille when they fail dig
Yeah ain't I nasty too nasty to trash me
Bash me aiyo that's dead so don't ask me
You'd get bumped off if beef ever jumped off
I never come soft I gotta pump that sawed-off
But when I let slugs out you will get rubbed out
For dissin you come up missing like a cub scout

Rappers be funny like Fletch 'cause they sections say they slaughter son
Talk about nines and tecs and never shot a watergun
But Killa Kam I get erratic when it comes to static
There you have it a trigger fanatic with a automatic
Increase the peace that cease 'cause once I release
My crew from the east we leavin at least
Twenty police deceased it's the beast on attack
So make tracks I break backs
I jack with def gats and black macs
On Lenox Avenue ain't no light looks you fight crooks
Left and right hooks if you front get your life took

I'm having nail-sharp pains in my brain like a Hellraiser
I'm blazin trails from jail cells so a trailblazer
Who find crime and fill the nine with nothin but lead
In backyard alleys but I call em crackyard valleys
And I pack more rallies than riots back in Cali
And people wanna know the reason why I blow my fuse
I'm in a daze and I'm so confused
From seein heads shake so many times the lead make
And Mike Boogie's next up and keep my head straight

I should never rhyme 'cause every time I step into a contest
Kids evacuate the premises like it's a bomb threat
'Cause they know when I start droppin' poems
That I be knockin' domes poppin' bones and sendin' niggas hoppin' home
Word to God it's kinda hard for a fag to touch this
So if you're coming to see me nigga bring a cast and crutches
And niggas I don't need a gun for you none of you
'Cause I can kill you dead with the lead from my Number 2
And it's death in every paragraph
And niggas learn when I burn their motherfuckin' ass to ash
No need to question am I nice 'cause it's a fact friend
I shoot the gift like Santa Claus with a Mac-10
And niggas ain't half as nice so they get sacrificed
And sent to the afterlife they ain't no match for Mike
Now I'm bout to skate in a rush just finished makin' it tough
Peace to Big L aiyo 8 is enough

I gotta say peace to D-Whiz and Short Man
Brothers that was there since the beginning
Peace to Mase Murder and the B.B.O. Crew
And all the other crews that's representin in Harlem
You know what I'm sayin 
And last but not least
Coming at you once again in nine-five
And I dedicate this one to all my peoples from Uptown and everywhere

Yo where I'm from it ain't cookies and cream
There's a lot of peer pressure growin' up as a young teen
You never know when you gonna get wet
'Cause mad clowns be catchin' wreck with a Tec just to get a rep
Instead of cool friends they'd rather hang with male thugs
Instead of goin' to school they'd rather sell drugs
It's best to go the right route and not the wrong one
Because it's gonna catch up with you in the long run
Brothers be on the corners actin' stupid gettin' lifted
They life is twisted and most of them are quite gifted
In other words they got talent
But they'd rather sell cracks and bust gats
And run the streets actin' violent
To them it's all about hittin' skins and makin' some easy green
'Cause that's all they show you on the TV screen
All they care about is a buck or bustin' a sweet nut
They don't give a  'cause they street struck

Before the rap contract I was sellin' crack
Stay strapped with a Mac I was into all of that
I started rappin' and got nice as hell
If it wasn't for this I might be doin' life in jail
And some of my peeps are still in the game selling 'caine
If that's what you gotta do to maintain
Go 'head and do your thang
But with the cash profit make an investment
And try not to go to the grave like the rest went
'Cause you can be rich with crazy loot own a house and nine cars
What good is that if you're dead or behind bars 
And yo it's not even funny
I've seen a lot of my peers give up their careers
For some fast money
They could've been boxers ballplayers or rap singers
Instead they bank robbers and crack slingers
Ayo they used to be legit kids now they corrupt
They had dreams but gave 'em up 'cause they street struck

You better listen to 'cause being street struck'll get you nothin' but a bullet or jail time

I still chill with my peeps in the streets
But most of the time I'm in the crib
Writing rhymes to some dope beats
Or either calling up some freaks to bone
But word up I try to leave the streets alone
But it's crazy hard kid in other words it's spooky
The streets be callin' me like the crack be callin' Pookie
It ain't a dumb joke listen to this young folk
'Cause where I'm from you can choke from the gun smoke
Stay off the corners that might be your best plan
Before you catch a bullet that was meant for the next man
Or end up with a deep cut
Or relaxin' on a hospital bed from bein' street struck

Ayo take it from me the Big L 'cause I been through it all you know what I'm sayin'
Stay off them corners you'll stay out of trouble
And I gotta say rest in peace to all the casualties of the streets
I'm outta here
Let me get to the point real quick
When your pockets are thick mad chicks be on a brother's tip
When ya sporting jewels and driving in a groovy car
All the ho's gonna sweat you like a movie star
To get in your pockets that's what them girls wanna do
But if you not rich them chicks gonna front on you
No matter how strong your rap
You only knock boots when you got loot and you on the map
'Cause if you broke you'll get a whack slut
If you got dough you get a ho with a fat butt
With fresh gear long hair and a cute face
And if you live alone she's gonna pack her suit case and move in
Then you start losing all your bucks
Soon you broke as a joke and out of luck
Then she takes off and breaks off your ho's gone so long dear
I'm outta here a good relationships been torn
'Cause when you on top everything's okay
But when you broke you gets no play

Girls of the nineties ain't nothing but crooks
It's all about what's in your pockets not how you look
That's why you can't talk to just any whore
Leaving brothers for the next man 'cause he's got a penny more
They want a drug dealer not a scholar
Some girls barely speak but always asking for a dollar
And if you pushing a fresh Benz they'll be your best friends
Yeah as long as you collect ends
You think she's all yours but as soon as your dough go
Your ho go now you solo
But when you was makin' papes selling jumbos
You bought dumb clothes for all of them bum ho's
And you was taking em to the movies every weekend
Now that you dead broke the girls stopped speaking
'Cause nowadays girls want you to trip
The only thing they can get from Big L is a big
'Cause when you on top everything's okay
But when you broke you gets no play

I tell it how it is 'cause I'm a bold figure
And I hate a money hungry girl gold-digger
It ain't even funny
Some girls don't even know me asking me can they get some money
I'm looking nothing like your poppa
I wouldn't give a chick ten cent to put cheese on a Whopper
They wanna know why I'm so fly
A girl ask me for a ring and I put one around her whole eye
Chicks used to diss but now they wanna kiss
Yo Showbiz I'ma break it down like this

It's like that y'all and that's a fact y'all
I hit hoes from the back and don't give a jack y'all
It's Big L y'all I'm living swell y'all
I do my thing that's why my name ring bells y'all
If you don't got endz they act like they never saw you
Crooked corrupted criminal crime boss with cream
Cocaine hustler blowing out the brains of busters
Be in my mansion chillin' inhalin' the ganja smoke
Counting mad cream weighin' tons of coke
Guarded by thugs and Rottweilers
I flood the streets with drugs and clock dollars
Niggas get plugged when my Glock hollers
Skunk smokers Philly and Owl ripper
Cristal sipper I've been a willy for a while nigga
'Gruff got hoes the man with all the nachos
Expensive hot clothes drop top Rolls
East coast West coast fiends overdose
'Gruff get the cream with my team and I'm ghost

This money be temptin' me to jump out the MPV
Empty three clips of hollow tips with no sympathy
Since fourteen I sold morphine for more green
Kept dope in a Nautica coat under the drawsting
And watched out for cops squad cars and Beemers
And laundry ninas flee the country to Argentina
Laid back in the beach  coastin' with commuters
Smokin' the buddahs on the cruiseline boat to Aruba
For a while yo pump the vowel so I can pile dough
Then become a Harlem kingpin just like Alpo'
Get paid so I can lay low in San Diego
With yayo so I can ship it out whenever I say so

Yo Makin' this money is the American Dream
East Coast to West Coast you know what I mean
Whether it's Uptown Downtown you pick the scene
You gots to get your own scheme
We ain't splittin' this cream

Yo I'mma run hysterically till they bury me
Count numerically hills of Beverly
More grands than cherokee president like Eric B. and Rakim
Drug game I'm top ten locked in Right now its not an option
And those who creep got the Mac in the heat
They got the five-inch screens in the back of the seat
And now they got this daddy raggin'
Last year had me saggin' wasn't ready
When Heavy was back tossed me in the paddywagon
But ain't nobody out here stoppin' love
'Cause we was twelve years old in the Cotton Club poppin' bub'
So all the fame without the fortune goddamn you wrong
Killa kid Cameron surviving in the Amazon

Yo I leave you dazed and froze
With all kinds of amazing flows
Money surrounded I counted
While bathing with Asian hoes
Back home niggas is after me
I'm back to sea sippin' daquiris
Coke factory fiends baggin' up crack for me
From cutting up rocks to investing in stocks
Nautica yachts and knots busting outta my socks
Now that Bloods play the chub
All the ladies love me they hate who made me hubby
Behind my back they say my baby's ugly
Each night I sleep with freaks with Lamborghini jeeps
Neighbors be sneaking peeks how my semen leaks between the sheets
Mess up my loot I cut your collars Juan
'Cause these is modern times and the only thing I see is dollar signs

Check it To be seen clean in the mean Beam
Is every team's dream Big L's a cream fiend
With more green than Springsteen
You know I'm crazy quick to smack a groupie
I'm known to mack a hoochie
Harlem kids is known for felonies
Be yellin 'freeze ' we stash cheese
And keep a pocket full of centuries
Ayo I'm set for the rest of my life
Some clown that laid the threat 'cause I had sex with his wife
I stuck my tool to his brain said act a fool and get slain
Nigga yo' bitch chose me you know the rules to the game

Ayo I'm serious I'm not the type to joke a lot
Dressed in all black never seen in polka dots
No other write rhymes like these
I'm cool as a light breeze I'm playin' rappers out like striped Lees
I'm smoother than velvet my lyrics are well-written
I don't roll with punks I only roll with live guys
I had beef with this thief named Randolph
Now he's in a casket dressed up with his hands crossed
So you better leave L alone
Before I reach out and touch you but not with a telephone
Yo I'm the brother that you never even thought of beatin'
Black white or Puerto Rican I'm gonna slaughter each and
Every crab MC that runs up
When a battle comes up give me two thumbs up

I damage all opponents as soon as the bell rings
The crown is still mine 'cause I drop ill rhymes
A lot of rappers talk that murder shit and couldn't kill time
One two one two crews I run through
Fuck karate Big L practice Gun Fu
'Cause I'm a MC assassinator
I grab the mag and leave a nag leakin' like activator
Step to this and get shanked up
I knocked out so many teeth the tooth fairy went bankrupt
And I entertain well because of my brain cells
I'm naughty and stop callin' me shorty my name's L
My raps are hotter than the Bahamas
MC's be talkin' about breakin' jaws when they couldn't break a promise
With Big L you can't swing long
So get behind me and sing 'cause every hero got a theme song

The Big L's back to attack with a phat rap
Matter of fact black I'm puttin' Harlem on the map
Wassup 'cause I'm a stiggy star
Breakin' 'em up and then takin' they heart
You better believe that Big L is the man that be rippin' the microphones apart
I'm undefeated that's the stone truth
'Cause battlin' me is like fightin' a gorilla in a phone booth
I take lives with no pride I just committed a homicide
A punk brother died 'cause he tried
To take my cash but he didn't last I pulled out fast
He tried to bash then I blast on his monkey ass 
I make a lot of dough I'm quick to spot a foe
Even if my grandma violate she gotta go 
When I was young I played with guns not a kiddy toy
'Cause I'm a rough rugged gangsta not a pretty boy
Facts on tracks I recite well
Everybody wanna be like Mike but Mike wanna be like L

I drive up and down Harlem blocks iced-out watch
Knots in my socks cops think I'm selling rocks
Pulling me over to see if I'm drunk but I'm sober
They wouldn't fuck with me if I drove a Nova
Listen Columbo you're mad because your money come slow
And what you make in a year I make in one show
Now you wanna frisk me and search my ride
Call me all kind of names try to hurt my pride
You're just mad 'cause I'm a young cat pockets dumb fat
I'm through with that illegal life I'm staying legit
I love to see cars come cruising by and playing my shit
I walk around with six thou' without a pistol my whole clique's wild
I'm rich pal no more sticks I'm making hits now
I drink Cristal I'm through breaking laws
I don't sell coke any more I do tours
So get that flashlight out of my face
To bring me down them Jakes will do whatever it takes
Word up them Federals got my phone and my house tapped
Praying that I fall for the mousetrap I doubt that

Why do I end up in so much shit 
I done came way too far to be calling it quits
Jake wanna lock me up even though I'm legit
They can't stand to see a young brother' pockets get thick

Aiyo enough's enough Federals try to set me up
Put me in cuffs and crush what I lust into dust
Plus they want a nigga's soul but they know
Big Joey Crack will never rat a cat that he know
For sure death before dishonor I left the streets alone
Since Tone deceased it almost killed his mama
So I'ma keep doing what I'm doing
Pursuing my dream till there's enough cream to start my own union
And show these kids how legit it is
Shit is real I used to steal but now I own several businesses
So where's your witness that you claim to have
Saying that I'm taking half extorting New York and not paying tax 
I'm laid back playing the role laying the low
But it's the same old Joe so don't get KO'd
Hey yo I'm gonna fry for what I never did
Or catch a heavy bid why don't they just let a nigga live 

What would you do if a vicious enemy Suddenly started coming at you
Armed to the teeth and ready to kill you

Yo I'm straight loco to hell with you and your broke ho
You ain't a big dog you more like Toto you got no dough
I smoke 'dro mixed with cocoa strong as bolo
Chips from here to Acapulco
While y'all buck for legs I buck for heads
I even buck celebs nigga fuck the feds
My underground niggas y'all can shine with me
Got my own label now so y'all can sign with me
Y'all can take me from the bottom and climb with me
That's fine with me that's how it was designed to be

Gats we bust backs we crush
Only hot tracks we lust crazy stacks we clutch
And we need plaques to touch that say platinum plus
'Cause half of you niggas that's rappin' now is wack to us

And cats still wonder can they get as hot as he been
That probably depends let me show you how to begin
Bang chicks in Marriotts down to Quality Inns
Hit the bar spend cash like Monopoly ends
Plushed out rock gators and exotical skins
Come in the hood flippin the chicken and broccoli Timbs
Niggas come in the game block they shot at the rim
That ain't in you the fuck you gon' possibly win
Keep a steady grip make cream just like Ready Whip
Heavy with styles that's the deadliest
Cats on that petty shit watch how much lead he get
You tryin to go places chasin Oasis
About nothin gettin low wages
Drink Hennessy with no chasers
Right hook is like Joe Frasier's
I'm the bodacious body parts are big and like Schwarzenegger's
Smokin' Garcia Vega tryin to get the larger paper
If you block the cash we lockin ass
I'mma put it in your chest like a Stockton pass
Only out to earn figures like we please
But I don't mind to burn niggas like CDs
Now exhibit styles I kick with it
Pardon me but I'm fuckin sick with it

Gats we bust  
Only hot tracks we lust  
And we need plaques to touch  
'Cause half of you niggas that's rappin' now  
My nigga C-Town my big brother Big Lee holding it down
Flamboyant baby for life
We taking over coming to a theater near you
Check it out come on check it

Make sure my mic is loud and my production is tight
Better watch me 'round your girl if you ain't fuckin' her right
You damn playa haters never want to see me blow
Flamboyant Entertainment CEO
Yo the spotlight is mine it ain't his no more
When Lee come home niggas can't live no more
And I'm straight keep a Harlem World mindstate
I never lounge where you find Jake
Suprise niggas like a blind date L rhyme great
And I'mma increase the crime rate for old time's sake
Run with me and I'm a make you a star
When me and my crew hit the clubs we go straight to the bar
Leave 'em empty I cruise through Harlem in an BMW
Never pay for parties say my name and I'm in free
Selling niggas that wet shit right out the jar shit
I'm dumb hot I'll wreck you and your young flock
Keep the gun cock represent one block
We quick to put a bullet in a stranger's dome
I'm known to kick a rough rhyme and rock much shine
Yo I'm out I done took up enough time

A smooth kid that'll run up in your baby mother
Corleone is too advanced for y'all
Big L I'm a pimped-out nigga for real
Big L Corleone is too advanced for y'all

Yo it's Corleone and Queen's Most
We bust 'til your whole team ghost
Everywhere we go we must bring toast
Forever poppin' the chrome always droppin' a poem
I can write it or recite it off the top of the dome
However you want it is
How I'm gonna give it to you Big L style
They brought it back to the streets 'cause that shit sell now
So pal back up a bit give me some elbow space
I represent Harlem World not Melrose Place
So I'ma lace the jewels up with nice baguettes
Flamboyent is the label that writes the checks
Y'all niggas better stop fronting 'cause I might get vexed
And I'ma run up on y'all and slice yours necks
With the machette pockets heavy
Slang more cane than Eddie I represent uno tres nueve
Time is money so I stay late I'm quick to slide a playmate
I gotta represent it somebody gotta do it 'cause I'm the most valuable poet when it comes to this shit and I'ma prove it right now check it out

My clique is quick to put a bullet in a stranger's dome
You should have known not to roam through the Danger Zone
In Harlem is where the thugs rest in a slug fest
We sending faggots all the way to heaven like Doug Fresh
Big L grew up in the slums of greed known for drawing guns with speed
And selling tons of weed 'cause I got sons to feed
And it's a must that my toast smokes I'm not like most folks
Fuck tens and twenties I carry ghost-notes
And it's a must that I commence to slaying
Any faggot MC who goes against the grain
I'mma smoke Pataki ass and Rudolph Giuli' like a wooley
I keep a tooly for any moolie who act fooly
So if a nigga disrespect L to hell is where I'mma send em'
After I skin em' and spit some venom in em'
I run with intruders looters and sharpshooters
Who spark buddahs and fuck thick bitches with large hooters
Yo I'm the nigga that be jumping on your stereo
When I walk the streets the bitches be tapping they friends like there he go 
Never had rules to follow none of my jewels are hollow
Try to tax mines and you'll be on the news tomorrow
'Cause I never was the type to start beefs
But I spark creeps on dark streets and stop they heart beats
To hell with silly games I play survival sports
Sometimes I be in the crib stressed the fuck out with suicidal thoughts
All my life I've been a lady bruiser a wrong chooser
School refuser drug abuser born loser
Clothes bummy nose runny it wasn't funny
A little dummy who tried to kill his mother for insurance money
Now me and the devil is on the same team
I'mma hit the mainstream with ill raps that's poison like gangrene
I'm better than every rapper that you thought was raw
Peace to all of my peoples out in Baltimore
I'm not a coward and fronting on me I won't allow it
I'm high powered fucking freak bitches like Adina Howard
Front and get your belly torn I keep a Pelle on
I'm fucking with Grey Poupon and Dom Perignon
On the ave I pump rocks quick to give a chump knots
You ain't tough the only thing you shooting is jump shots
My style is hard like strong lumber
Cute chicks get the dick ugly bitches get the wrong number
Hey yo the streets love me man
And I love the streets
So I know ya ain't think I was comin' with some fruitcake shit
Ya know me better than that
Ayo I should have been out
I'm deadly when I pull the pen out
Keep frontin' I'mma try yo' chin out
I knocked a lot of men out
I left 'em on the floor spittin' phlegm out
It's either that or I'mma squeeze the gat and pop ten out
You see Corleone ice spinnin' jigged out white linen
And if a bitch don't like me she must like women
Every time I come around you see your wife grinnin'
Don't be mad 'cause yo' career's in the ninth innin'
It's over now nigga leave the game
I'm from the danger zone where emcees get slain
Where thugs'll never hesitate to squeeze the flame
Where niggas be takin' drugs just to ease the pain
When I was OT yo bitch wrote me
First day home I dived in it
Left her thighs dented
Now that bitch be pagin' me every five minutes
Emcees I squash and disgrace it's all about the Benjis
So why your bills got Washington's face 
A lot of cats be frontin'
Mad singles wit' a fifty on top
L tryin' to have the city on lock
Peace to Biggie and Pac 'cause they were really hot
Rap game heavy hitters it's a shame they no longer wit' us
Niggas wanna be L ladies wanna see L
Word up man them niggas is hungry
They ready to bite a nigga arm off

All my wolves in the house are you live or what 
See Harlem 'bout to get it all eyes on us
Only ghetto niggas shine who gon' rise wit' us 
And the first cat who act we gon' size 'em up
Ayo I hear a lot of bitch in your talk
See a lot of switch in your walk
Only thugs get rich in New York
Because they sick of all this drag queen shit
Your wife's missin' I'm the nigga she was last seen wit'
Me and Ron hit it up on some tag team shit
A buncha niggas got smoked for the cash
Used to ride Greyhounds wit' dime hoes who stuff the coke in they ass
Crazy beef's got provoked in the past lot of wigs got split
A lot of innocent kids got hit
Harlem World be the place of my birth believe me son
We breed the smoothest niggas on the face of the earth
Mics I steadily smoke rhymes cleverly wrote
As long as I can rock a crowd I'mma never be broke
Some hoes treated me like a bum nerve when I was unheard
Now I'm icey I ain't gotta say one word you dumb bird
I push whips while you walk all day
And I hate when strange niggas wanna talk all day
Clown ass shit hate to be around that shit
You don't know me just say whatsup gimme a pound that's it
When I was at the steak house pullin' cake out
You was at some cheap Chinese shit gettin' take out
How you make out you took the fake route you oughta break out
You couldn't get a bitch before you put your tape out

You know the game plan
C-Town that's my main man
We never bring luggage we go shopping when the plane lands
Still run with the same clan used to be a Kane fan
Everything I rock is name brand
L'll make your dame swallow
Your ice don't shine and your chain hollow
While you front in clubs for hours with the same bottle
Takin midget sips I run with the richest clicks
Tap the thickest chicks plus drop the slickest hits
You know nothing about L so don't doubt L
What's this motherfucking rap game without L 
That's like jewels without ice
That's like China without rice
Or the Holy Bible without Christ
Or the Bulls without Mike
Or crackheads without pipes
The Village without dykes
Or hockey games without fights
Don't touch the mic if you unable to spit
Flamboyant is the label I'm with motherfucker
There are too many MC's who are overrated
You ask me they wasn't even supposed to make it
In the rap biz they don't know what rap is
So give it up become a actor or a actress
Or a producer 'cause you fail to use the
Mic right so take flight before I bruise ya
For sayin those bull crap wack raps on wax
You need to get smacked sit back and rip that contract
Hey yo I'm serious Big L ain't playin games
I should get foul and buck wild and start sayin names
But deep down inside you know who you are
Your rhymes are not up to par you fake superstar
And that really gets on my nerve
When a rapper gets the credit that he don't deserve
Goin platinum and don't have no soul
Some rappers are mad nice and don't even go gold
I don't like the way it's goin down
Because it should be the other way around

I don't understand it 
How MC's take this rap game for granted

MC's what's goin on 
I don't understand man how rappers cold transform
One minute you're hardcore and raw
That's what you was known for but not no more
You changed you rearranged
You're not the same your raps are plain
That explain why you lost your fame
Used to be on top then you fell like rain drops
You turned pop now you no longer gain props
Who's fault is that Nobody's but your own black
Used to make fat tracks jack but now you're stone wack
So MC's don't ever step out your range
Remain the same
And only change with the time
Unless you get dropped like a dime
Go for yours like I'm goin for mine
But if you're rough stay rough if you're dap stay dapper
And never try to look or even sound like another rapper
Just fulfill your own needs
Some rappers wore gold chains and now they're wearin beads

This is how it should be done
I'm not the one and my raps is strong like rum
But some MC's grab the mic and sound dumb
Plus slum  Rap skills they have none
And I wonder how the hell they records sell
They raps are stale and frail
They're false like fairy tales
Your technique and everything you speak's weak
You got a little airplay because of your beats
Your fame and your name but your lyrics are lame black
Step to this and get ran over like train tracks
Your raps border wack and you went on tour with that
Crap don't understand it 'cause rhyme skills you lack
I got more soul that Nike Airs givin MC's nightmares
Rappers be frontin hard and rhymes they don't write theirs
But still call themselves MC's
Please how could that be 
Some people was born in heaven
With a silver spoon in they mouth
And had everything handed to them on a silver platter
And never had to work hard for nothing
Then there are some people that was born in the opposite world
Of those that was born in heaven which is called hell
And had to work hard for everything they got
And never had nothing handed to them  and never will

I'm only at the age of ten
And life already seems to me like it's heading for a dead end
'Cause my Moms be smoking mad crack
My Pops went out for a fast snack and never brought his ass back
Nobody knows how I feel it's quite ill
'Cause I had to steal to fill my stomach with a nice meal
Too ashamed to walk the streets
Wearing the same cheap sneaks and dirty outfits for weeks
Even my holidays got damaged
'Cause on Christmas I asked Santa for a father and a hot sandwich
I just can't take it

Five years passed by now I'm at the age of fifteen
No more fun and games it's time to get cream
'Cause I'm about to burst it's like my life was cursed
I went to church prayed everyday and it still got worse
Soon I ran into a couple of guns
Started stalking the streets late robbing suckers for funds
Now everyday I creep with the heat ain't nothing sweet
I rob for meat If I don't steal I don't eat
Then I lost control and started going too far
Robbed this brother named Umar then got snatched by the blue car
Where I grew up it was a living Hell
Then I started to realize I'm better off in a prison cell
Now I can sleep now I can eat
Can't hit skins but I wasn't hitting skins when I was in the street

Doing time was full of stress G
All the fightings and stabbings and men finding men sexy
One tried to test me didn't find it humorous
Beat him with a pillowcase filled with cans of tuna fish
My time came to a cease I'm back on the streets again
I hope I don't get snatched by the beast again
But it's getting crazy hectic 'cause I'm broke get up naked
And can't get a job 'cause of my jail record
Before you know it I was robbing them same ducks
I even started robbing homeless folks for their change cups
My whole life was deserted
Either I'ma go back to jail or get murdered but do I deserve it 
All I tried to do was live the one life that I got
But it seems like I can't get a fair shot
I just can't take it
And every day I ask myself 'How will I make it '

Word up man it's real rough out here man
In the ghetto all you can wish for is a better tomorrow
It ain't getting no better it's only getting worse word up
Hah in the streets and in jail
Yeah yo it's your man Big L
I got my man Tommy Gibbs and Corleone with me
Aiyyo I just left the studio and it's about two in the morn'
Just finished doin a song
Now I'm ready for sleep
But first I want spaghetti to eat
And there's a good Italian restaurant right up the street
So I jump in the Jeep stash the heat under the seat
Then I got a beep my voice is hoarse barely can speak
I called back on the cell
Told me to listen well as he started to yell
Now I'm in the Range
Switchin lanes doin a buck 'n change
I can't wait to touch them lames and them fuckin dames
I reach the destination
Grab the heat without no hesitation
These niggas fuckin up my reputation
I saw Corleone holdin the chrome
Ice-grill lookin like he had a license to kill
And he had somebody else with 'em playin the cut
Lookin like he can't wait to start sprayin shit up
Oh I didn't recognize you with your hat down
Son you ready We got this whole shit mapped out
I hope you ain't scared there's no time to back out
We gon' take the back route
And pull the gats out and throw the mask on
We ain't leavin til everyone's dead and all the cash gone
We gon' get our laugh on when we through
But right now we got a job to do So let's do it
I stepped to the desk clerk
Put the gat to her dress-shirt
Told her listen up before she get hurt

I took the steps now I'm out of breath I gotta stop smokin
Them cigarettes gon' be the 'cause of my death
My heart beatin fast now 'cause it's about to pop off
Saw the door let the Glock off tore the lock off
Took a deep breath then ran inside at a quick pace
I felt disgraced I should have shot that bitch in the face
Then my other two niggas ran in each had a cannon
Ready to take care what we been plannin
These two crab cats we know they hustle upstate
We know they got stacks
'Cause they don't fuck with nothin but weight
We got the cuffs and the duct tape and put it to use
Then told 'em when this is over we'll be lettin 'em loose
And then I kicked Mike in his face to watch his head jerk back

He gave me the address then I ran outside
But first I took the keys to his van outside
And when I got there I found fifty ki's in a stash
A hundred pounds of grass and two million in cash
I was dumb glad the shit didn't fit in one bag
So I got three filled 'em all up to the T
I put the bags in the van then I locked the truck
When I got back Corle' done popped them punks
Now that's four bodies
Two outta-towners and two hotties
And after that we ain't sleep for three days
We hit the PJ's split the money three ways
Now we all laughin hard gettin nice and weeded
Celebratin nigga heist completed
Yo on the scene is the brother that's big I'm not a little kid
I'm a nig who don't dig a muthafuckin pig
'Cause to me they ain't nothin but harassers
That misuse they badges to whip niggas' asses
Then one day they slow rolled through the hood
With the Smith Wesson cocked 2 deep up to no good
They say that my skin was black so they attacked
Threw me on the back and stuck a gat to my fuckin cap
One murdered my man like it was okay
For the life he ended he got suspended with no pay
But if a man woulda took the cop life he woulda got life
And never again see the street lights and that's trife
Around my way they shot many teens
And them cops better stop or I'mma stop em by any means
The Big L won't hesitate to cold diss em
And if you ask me muthafuck the whole system
There are too many young black brothers doin life bids
'Cause justice means 'just us white kids'
So take heed to the rhymes I kick
I'm about to flip 'cause I'm fed up with that bullshit

Whether it's the hot warm cool or the cold season
Pigs be fuckin with a nigga for no reason
You're just gettin home from work
And gotta get searched and treated like dirt by a fuckin jerk
Niggas in the streets got tough luck
First they get cuffed up
Then get roughed up and that's fucked up
This every day not every other week
Listen when this brother speak
Muthafuck turnin the other cheek
Or you'll be layin' in a pine box
Bad enough they got Smith Wesson now them clowns gettin nine Glocks
I'm not only fed up with the cops
I'm also fed up with them punk-ass cab drivers who don't stop
They don't care if it's snowin
First they slow down then they see your skin is brown then they keep goin
'Cause I wasn't white the cab took flight
But I caught him at the light
And put a bullet right through his windpipe
I keep a tool with a full clip the trigger I pull quick
'Cause I'm fed up with that bullshit
Big L Yea yeah Flamboyant Entertainment

Yo y'all fellas like to stress them chicks
Impress them chicks spend money to dress them chicks
I sex them chicks and send them home
Corleone is known to be stoned
When I bone I'm rubbered up in case that shit full blown
The other night around eight
Went to the ATM took a thou' out
Then later on I had to wild out
In the club knock some coward and his pal out
Then afterwards went to the restroom pissed Cristal out
Now I'm thinkin which chick number I could dial out
'Cause it's L the Harlem pimp baby for real
I got more dimes than that Sprint lady
And that's ill playa haters be givin me harsh looks
But I'm tryin to sell records like Garth Brooks
So eff 'em all when it's cold I throw the skelly on
Illegal chips keep my celly on
If it ain't Cristal boo I guess it's Perignon
If the girl's too tight I throw some jelly on
Yo try to tax and watch the nine mill burst
I've been off the scene over three years
And cats is still thirst to hear Big L drop an ill verse
So all you unsigned cats that want to battle 
Get a deal first I sport the bulletproof fitted hat
That attitude you better get rid of that
Wherever you floss is where you gon' get it at
What I stay strapped I go to sleep with my steel
Makin figures while you broke cats keepin it real
L is rap's most livest cat
I'm gettin stacks while you askin people
I rob fags in the staircase no mask bare-faced
The one police wouldn't dare chase
Keep my gear laced do I walk around without papes No way pal
Word up my money longer than the OJ trial

Yeah Harlem world keep holdin it down for Big L
Nigga long overdue niggas wanna know

Yo what the hell y'all can tell Spit Not shit
I did a flick and bounced on L's shit
Well shit expect me to go platinum
That's the only reason why I'm rappin
And since L passed niggas expect me to make it happen
With no release date I sell in each state
I'm the type to drive to Philly for a cheesesteak
So what I'm a Harlem king doin my thing
My name ring chains and dames what the fame bring
After platinum it's the same thing
And niggas'll never learn
Til I pull the steel and make they lover burn
You don't get another turn game's over
Here's my flamethrower
Rearrange your Rover Harlem soldier
Wait til I get older and we won't stop
I thought Mase told ya
Nigga Stan he do what he gotta
And these haters can't do me nada
Be in Nevada with a lot of enchilada

Yo move the fuck back
A bring the heat when I touch tracks
These niggas beef then wanna chill Fuck that
These rap niggas with the mills we deduct that
I asked all my ghetto cats where my love at
Now where the brews and the drugs at 
Corrupt cats kept slug hats
Asked the feds where the bugs at
Puff with the dread 'cause I puff black
High til I die and you can trust that
All I wanna know is the club packed 
I see the haters sweatin shorty but I dug that
She put my nutsac back where her lungs at little ho
And them niggas who owe give up that
Huh it's me and Corle' like Eddie and Nolte
Go ahead and provoke me
Heard you rap wanna rhyme Better be dope B
Y'all the ill written still fuckin like Bill Clinton

Aiyyo I heard your single you better make a whole new song
If they said that shit is hot then they told you wrong
Clown niggas you ain't got a chance at all
Big L Corleone too advanced for y'all
I make moves and boss all across the world
So don't be upset if I toss your girl
I got cheddar to blow pockets never get low
Bitches sweat me wherever I go
Nautica sweats with the fresh Gortex
Jewels with baguettes swingin like the Mets
Throwin the dice and takin all side bets
Never bummy sip rummy get money
When I hit honies she felt the dick in her tummy

Yo all of y'all weak people fall back
Goin back to back where they brawl at
Swing and walk with tall bats
Leavin' big holes with small gats
Have 'em all fallin where the wall at

Yo from the spot to the cellblocks
Hot as hell blocks where shells pop
Where they sell rock to cop the SL drop
Hood bitches in nail shops no good snitches that tell cops
People find bodies in lobbies you can smell shots
Niggas turn stale on the Rock until they bail drop
New York livin got a nigga four-fifth liftin'
Send you as a gift to the mortician
If you forfeit livin my fortune is forbidden
I say it one time before spittin
Then I leave your forehead drippin
I laid low then came back for more bread grippin
More thread flippin
More head from chickens it's time to turn the ape loose
Bust out the cage and let the gauge loose
Blow the feathers out of your Northface goose
It's G. Rap comin back with a click of brave troops
Have y'all niggas runnin for homebase like Babe Ruth
Have you holdin holes in your body like you play flute
Lay you down til you get found up in the sprayed Coupe
Prepare for the takeover give you the face makeover
The seedier row and sheet draped over
Be found on the block with the street taped over
Or comin out of deep coma your speech made slower
Corona Queens shakedown I'm comin with the nickel-plate pound
To trade rounds with all you fake clowns get down in the unsafe town
Lacin it down black guerilla fams kid we takin the crown

It's Flamboyant y'all
Me and my man was cruisin through the streets and everything was flowin nice
The corner's crowded niggas must be rollin dice
I parked the ride so my nigga Iroc can crash the lye spot
And I'mma gamble until he come back why not 
The game was mad packed mad cats pockets was fat
They playin cee-lo my dick get hard when I see dough
I bets nothin less than a G yo you know my steelo
First I was losin then I started throwin headcrack
After headcrack got my bread back jumped in my red Ac'
I'm waitin for my nigga to come out of the spot
I see niggas startin to plot and I'm far from my block
My man was hungry so I dropped him off at Mickey D's
Now I'm alone headin home to rest my dome
Spotted some niggas trailin so I picked up the phone
Called Bones I said Yo son I'm on the run
Need your help before I get done
Meet me downstairs bring your big gun
I don't believe this
This nigga said he can't make it
'Cause some bitch is in his house butt-naked
And then he hung up
And this supposed to be my man and he don't give a fuck
That duck sold me out just to get a nut what 
I'm cruisin fast and they still behind me
The same nigga who I won the money from and his grimy crimey
It's about to get real hasty
Grabbed the steel took it off safety
'Cause I refuse to let these niggas waste me
I started to cruise fast then stopped short and made 'em crash
And now them fags is all bloody from the shattered glass
And one of them had passed when his face smashed the dash
I was injured too leakin with a deep gash
I ain't panicked I was quite calm
Couldn't use the right arm so I grabbed the gat with the left
Walked up to the car the creep was stuck in the seat
Looked at him shook my head then started buckin my heat
It's over now 'cause both of these motherfuckers asleep
I think I'm dyin I'm feelin weak out on my feet
But before I got some medical help I had to catch a cab first
That's where Bones live walked in the buildin staggerin
Lookin tore down shot his door down and beat his whore down
From the look in my eye he knew he would die
Started to cry stuck the gat to his head and said Why
Then he offered me all of his cheese
Then dropped to his knees and begged me please not to squeeze
Then his brains got blast out he's ass-out then I dashed out
Into the streets covered with blood about to pass out
The hospital's up a couple of blocks I'm on my way but
Damn here comes a couple of cops I pulled out
And started blowin they started blowin back I'm goin all out
I ain't holdin back I been to jail once and I ain't goin back
I kept shootin one shot caught a cop dead in his top
The other pig ducked behind a big truck
I was bleedin real bad and couldn't stop it
But still had the fifty thou' profit in my pockets
The coast was clear so I jetted to a park that was near
Seen kids playin everywhere then threw the cash in the air
I watched all of them run for they share
And all I can do was stare
I got weak and fell on my rear
Now I can hear the sirens that means here comes the Jakes
But it's too late I'm knockin on the pearly gates
Yeah casualties of a dice game
Never gamble with snakes
Let that be a lesson to ya
Yeah it's Corleone y'all
Yeah it's Flamboyant y'all
Big L y'all Flamboyant baby yeah
It's time to make power moves and get the chedda
And buy the real nice things that makes life better
No foolish acts moves must be clever
I'm down for whatever I gotta blow son it's now or never

I walk through the ruggedest blocks with jewels flooded with rocks
Hustlin' on hot corners that be smothered with cops
I must warn my Harlem crew roll strong
Word bond we leave mics torn
Y'all brothers slept too long now it's on
L Corleone will never flop records are forever hot
Front on me you better not
I keep the Barreta cocked
This goes out to my people's up town
Downtown mid town across town and outta town
You see me flossin often at all the club sites
At the bars buyin Cristals like they bud lights
My style is hard like strong lumber
Dime pieces get the digits chicken heads get the wrong number

Yo I announce facts
When I get busy over bounce tracks
Droppin lethal raps on wax so I can count stacks
I keep a heavy knot got a spot on every block
Honeys that's very hot get slid to the Marriott
Now I'm back and all the ladies still cheer for me
Whatever I write is gonna be tight
Cos if makin' hits is wrong I don't wanna be right
Never the less the East is were my crew rest
We bust caps that go through vests
We only do what we do best
And that's cripplin' you brittle men
Since you wanna play rough then say hello to my little friend

I like drop tops when it's hot
I like Lands when it's snowy
Bank account is fat like Joey
I'm not very religious you wouldn't call me holy
Spark up the you know what pop the moey
L stay flossin Presidential Rolly
Y'all brothers know me I step in parties with minks and fly links
Shorties hittin me with eyewinks as I buy drinks
And every girl I got looks like a model
If you ever see me with a chicken then she must of a hit the lotto
Uptown is my home and where I roam
I stand alone Big L Corleone got it sewn
Sellin' weight in and outta state to generate cake
The one jakes hate
Got homicide runnin' out of yellow tape
I pack toast with infra red scopes I turn crews to dead folks
If y'all fellas is playas I'm the head coach

Word up son It's time to blow
Stack that dough create a better life for me and my fam knaa i mean
I've seen the ghetto all my life its time i see some different
Get the picture  The big picture
When I cruise through the ghetto I drive slow
I'm quick to buck a duck and I don't give a fuck about you
A hardcore life I chose to explore
Therefore I lived raw and went to war with the law
My only picture was a mug shot slugs what thugs got
Pockets swellin' hot from sellin' tops on the drug spot
Gs was clocked fat knots went in the socks
And cops who tried to stop shop got knocked when I popped the Glock
Shit was ran right by me and my man Mike
'Cause I choose to use a gun don't mean that I can't fight
'Cause we could put the guns down and go one round
With the hands my man I ain't the one you'll get done clown
I can inverse my style 'cause I'm versatile
Quick to burst a child I'm livin' worse than foul
I pack two tecs in case your crew flex
I wet up the set in a sec and yell Who's next
To feel the wrath of a psychopath shoots it up like Shaft
Turn your staff into a bloodbath then laugh
You'll get smashed like a deli snack you're softer than jelly jack
I attack in black with a gat and a skully hat
On one three ninth street Malcolm X boulevard
It's full of hard brothers that's thick and quick to pull a card
I tell facts when the beat start
Listen here sweetheart the Big L is street smart
I fuck ducks and they crews up make 'em give the jewels up
For those who refuse I squeeze the uz and light them fools up
I had beef with this nigga named Randolph
Now he's in a casket dressed up with his hands crossed
A beat down from Big L that's what all pranksters get
Like Al Yankovic I'm on some real gangster shit
I'm never fuckin' with no handicapped or crippled bitches
Look at my scalp real close and you'll see triple sixes
Crimes I committed I'm a villain admit it
I'm the type to murder you then tell your moms I'm the kid who did it
Peace and love is somethin' that I don't rhyme about
Fuck what you heard you know what I'm about

It's the man with the rough flow
Some niggas don't like me but I don't give a fuck though
'Cause I'm in command y'all
I'm smackin' niggas up like Puerto Ricans play handball
I ain't the funny type
To joke around I gotta get my motherfuckin' money right
'Cause I got the right game
Definitely the wrong man to invite to a dice game
I'm rolling numbers with no practice
I'm snatchin' up the dough like motherfuckers owe taxes
'Cause I got strategy
I'm rollin' head crack trips and makin' all the brothers mad at me
Word I'm taxin' shit
I'm shittin' on niggas like I just had a laxative
Tryin' to earn props I ain't the one to see
You clowns'll fuck around and get played like a drum machine
Ya gotta find a better way
I'll pull ya card your file shit plus your resume
'Cause I don't play clown
I gotta get mine that's why my face stay frown
I don't smile don't try to pull my file
I'll lay your ass like tile you know my motherfuckin' style
So just slow down 'cause y'all can't throw down
And y'all can't accept that a nigga's makin' dough now
And I'm livin' better troop
And I'm makin' more noise than a fuckin' heavy metal group
I'm a cool man a brother with a smooth plan
That's why I'm seein' more papers than a newsstand
So peep it don't try to run around or speak it
Point blank I keep my whereabouts secret
While niggas are packin' steel actin' ill
I'm on the D.L. with a female and I'm stackin' bills
How I'm livin' Everything is well
'Cause a nigga like me yo I'm ringin' bells
Without doubt I got clout
Yo fuck that shit yo you know what I'm about
You better flee hops or get your head flown three blocks
L be keepin' niggas hearts pumpin' like Reeboks
It's the nigga that bitches suck and sweat
Faggots I buck and wet
Disrespect and I'm a break your fuckin' neck
I'm known to put a cap in a duck face
I spray guns fuck mace
I'm a nutcase from a rough place
It's called Uptown
Front and get bucked down
Walk through with jewels on that ass'll get stuck clown
I got styles you can't copy bitch
It's the triple six in the mix
I'm the devil's son like my song said
I smash niggas like cornbread
You can't kill me I was born dead
I wet shit up like a floodage
Me and my crew peel caps and carry gats like it's luggage
I'm nowhere near trash so step to the rear fast
Before I have your queer ass cryin' like tear gas
Every day I gain clout and my game sprout
Some niggas'll still be virgins if crack never came out
The Big L's hard to kill when my squad gets ill
You better guard your grill before you get scarred for real
Big L is a large boss
Known for puttin' more holes in a nigga body than a golf course
I'm crazy quick to knock a duck off
I'll pull out then buck off
And tear a nigga grill right the fuck off
You'll get smoked like a Phillie fast
'cause your shit is really trash
Fuck around I'll swing on ya silly ass
It's Big L the crime converter
Sayin' peace to all the niggas in jail doin' time for murder
I wreck the mic plus the whole stage
Rockin' cornrow braids
I'm killin' muthafuckers like old age
Known to have a hottie open
I keep a shotty smokin'
Front and get half the bones in ya body broken
I never false teach so listen as the boss preach
I only rock leathers by Marc Buchanan and North Beach
I'm makin' rap hits I snap flicks at mack chicks
Just the slim ones you won't see L with no fat bitch
Yo I'm the nigga that they call A.W.O.L
Punks I slay all on my spare time I play ball
In the playgrounds I spray clowns with trey pounds
Makin' gs from transportin' kis on Greyhounds
My shit is kickin' like a sensei
I'm smoother than Ben Gay
I'm outtie like M.J
So Herb McGruff
My mellow my nigga
Get on the mic and pull the MC trigger
Yo I got slugs for snitches
No love for bitches
Putting thugs in ditches when my trigger finger itches
I got a rep that make police jet
Known to get a priest wet
I never beg for pussy like Keith Sweat
Bitches get fucked on the roof when I ain't got no hotel dough
I'm known for yoking jacks
And beating them with smoking gats
Leaving token Blacks with broken backs and open caps
So with that bullshit step to the rear son
The last thing you want with Big L is a fair one
'Cause in a street brawl I strike men like lightning
You see what happened in my last fight friend
I beat kids with lead pipes
I leave a trail of dead mic's
Where I'm from niggas jewels get ran like red lights
Old folks get mugged and raided
Crimes are drug related
And we live by the street rules that thugs created
Clowns get smoked about a thousand volts
For selling pounds of coke
Front in this town and get a nine stuck down your throat
I'm telling you shit is about to get drastic soon
I'm quick to blast a goon
And break a motherfucker like a plastic spoon
I got the looks that make your hotty stare
I keep a shotty near
It's the nigga with knotty hair who Gotti fear
Tracks I'm know to roast
Until the microphone is ghost
Props I own the most
I'm leaving niggas comatose
Front and get your brain pinched
Big L will have your whole gang lynched
I started smoking dust and been insane since
This rap shit was a great gift
The other night some snake riffed
And got a hot lead face lift
All through high school I had braids
I kept mad blades
Stabbing teachers to death that gave me bad grades
I cook the mic like a beef steak
'Cause my technique's great
And I'm the nigga police hate in each state
'Cause I'm the neighborhood lamper
Punk brother vamper
Fuck around you'll find my silk boxers in your mother's hamper
Cops drop when my Glock makes a pow sound
I'm from a whyle town
You know my style clown so bow down

Brothers can beg and borrow Still feel sorrow
When Jay-Z like Zorro get in that ass
Better luck tomorrow
I'm too much nigga so never should you rush
You need slow down or get your ass tore down
Check it out I'm too cocky
To stop me you gotta kill me
And when I'm gone you can still feel me
The shit is eternal I rock the Heavens well
Even if they won't let me in Heaven
I raise hell till its Heaven
Recognize the black cat with the nine lives
Get up off me nigga its bad luck to cross me
I'm poppin Crystal shooting game like missiles
As projected all ho's affected by this style
I mack like Goldie go back like the oldies
They don't be knowing the way I be flowing
I be running the track like Jesse Owens
I disrupt the natural scheme
The way that you do things wit a swing and have em rocking like
You say never you run if ever you come
It's never you run so fast in your life to never have won
Come on and ride the rhythm
I be producing like jizm
Just like the gods I start with knowledge and follow with wisdom
For greater understanding
I'm landing blows and
Knocking sense into those that oppose me ha
Enticin when slicing through tracks
And God knows he can rap
Me and L put rhythm on the map
So give him his dap
And me I just take mine
Gimme those gimme this gimme that fuck that
You never see me stressed in a BMW
On the prize my greedy eyes can't see no less
Jigga incredible
Even my thoughts is federal
Like kidnapping extortion and corruption
So you know beatin me will never come
Like a nun or tomorrow I'm too thorough nigga
I make moves 'cause bowels to move
When I'm creeping through your hood with a thousand little dudes
We're the peace like Islam
I make your eyes rise like yeast
Surprise I feel no fear when facing y'all
Betcha lyrics jump off the track like racing cars
Emcee's trying to be the best
And even in dying couldn't be this def
I see no reason to stop cheesin
And we can get down and split the wealth
That's when I found I could do it myself
I'm from a place where them niggas don't talk no shit
Where them wigs get split where the guns forever click
Where the track stars come to warm up for a race
So much respect I can lay dough on the floor
Walk away and come back without cats runnin off
I'm a model ho's wet dream in her sleep
Performin X-rated fuck scenes me goin deep
O.C. the Starchild let your cameras record
I'm like a man bein honored at the Grammy awards
Knuckle gaze crumblin your glass jaw
Supreme figure drink liquor what team thicker 
Flamboyant forever this is how it goes
Pray we don't clap your way when the gats explode

Where I'm from dudes get sliced 'cause crews is trife
And you might lose your life for your jewels and ice
I'ma slide to the telly and abuse your wife
If I got one rubber I'ma use it twice
I give young fools advice about the rules of heist
Dimes I'm willin to hit I stay drillin a chick
They all know I ain't shit but they still on my dick
And I never walk the streets without the vest and the chrome
'Cause all my jewels be Rocky like Sylvester Stallone
I blast the tech at your dome to leave you restin alone
Go home and puff a fat bag of sess 'til I'm gone
You got this nigga frontin like he the main event
When his album ain't even last long it came and went
I'm like Gotti to him I throw the shotty to him

Hoodied down with the mac Boogie Down where it's at
Fuck around hear the sound of the gats
Wanna clown we react fuck that
Do you know what you do when you fool with Joey Crack 
I'm coke on the streets I'm open for beef
I'm hoping you reach so we can go with the heat
I'm like a nigga that you just can't kill
Niggas spittin that hot shit but just ain't real
Uhh it's like you muh'fuckers frontin for me
Nuttin to see when I'm the one you wantin to be
Lovin the stee' come through plush in the V
Got niggas mad 'cause they payin' while we fuckin for free
Make Trizz a household live what I told
I only speak that true shit that I know
Besides y'all don't want it with us
A hundred or plus killers that be livin to bust

Yo Remi so crazy rhymes be blazing
Styles just switch like hips on gay men
Trips to the Caymans rich and famous
Rhymes so hot my spit be flaming
Benz be rimmed up doo be pinned up
Bitch talk slick whole crew get hemmed up
My shit drastic all type of tactics
Rip shit flip shit spit shit backwards
Screw you don't let the pretty face fool you
I kick shit like kung-fu and I jam like guns do
You got one I want two like water I run through
Psycho make you wanna change your whole mic flow
Floss it givin bitches lyrical abortions
Stay cautioned my first shit was just a lil portion
I come back with more shit playback some raw shit
You can't rock so I'mma take your spot make you forfeit

Calling to see how that joint know what I'm sayin' came out

Hey yo fellas  Keep our eye open  watch out
Cos females be playing a whole lot of games like these

Aiyyo fellas you gotta be careful today
Watch out for games that these females play
'Cause some break the rules and some don't play fair
You might get caught out there if you're not aware

I know this lady by the name of Katie If you broke she's shady
You got cash she's ready to have your baby
The type of female the fellas stress
Stay fresh to death well dressed
In Chanel Guess nothing less
Body got more curves than an S I smoked the boots like Cess
And I confess the sex was the best 
Within a week she had keys to my res
I done mad her my main squeeze and gave her G's to invest
Then one day I overheard her talking to friends
Saying how she didn't like me all she want is the ends
Yo honey was sheisty
Had me thinking she was wifey tricking ridiculous
Given her dues that was icey I said it's over
And what I gave you you can have that
It wasn't even her it was myself I was mad at
Letting that dame use me for my name and my fame
That's lame but it's a shame how I fell for the game

A year ago I did a show for some dough
Puffed a bag of hydro then broke out on the low
And on my way out it was a female on my trail
Who followed me from the stage to the Benz
I asked honey her name she replied Monique
Soft and sweet from her head to feet hotter than heat
Jump in the passenger seat let's go get somethin to eat
She said I was that Roc-a-Fella she'd been dyin to meet
I tried to hit it first night she said she wasn't a freak
Yeah right it's all good so I waited a week
Then one night to my crib she decided to creep
Knocked on a nigga door and woke me outta my sleep
I let her in before you know it we was doin our thang
I drove her home and said tomorrow give me a ring
It was about a month later when she gave me a call
With some bogus ass story that was off the wall
Claimin she's pregnant with my child I think that's quite foul
How is that I wore a Lifestyle

Let me find out this gonna rock the clubs
All the thugs at the bar poppin' bubs
Dime pieces shake that ass show me love
This goes out to all of the above
Let me find out this gonna rock the clubs
All the thugs at the bar poppin' bubs
Dime pieces shake that ass show me love
This goes out to all of the above
I be that playa with the big street buzz who all the freaks love
Braided hair light moustache a little peach fuzz
That slim guy all my life been fly
Yo I was destined to be a star honey
Plus I rock jewels that cost car money
And cats like you never got rocks on
Rappin' bout Roleys and got a Swatch on
Playa hatas don't wanna see me blow
Flamboyant Entertainment C.E.O
Ya'll still envy me 'cause I'm MVP
Cruise through Harlem in a bulletproof MPV
Man you fuck around and get plugged like MTV
My style is rough like strong lumber
Cute chicks get the dick ugly bitches get the wrong number
I stay droppin' like April showers
Give me her address so I can send Rachel flowers
And I'm rap most livest cat
Gettin' stacks while you asking niggas Do you want fries with that 
Try to tax me and watch the nine mil' burst
I've been off the scene over two years and ya'll still thrist
To hear L drop a ill verse
And all you unsigned rappers that wanna battle get a deal first
I'm quick to smoke an ounce with my thugs
This be that party shit that make you bounce in the clubs
I defeat creeps with techniques on elite beats
Always front row never sittin' in the cheap seats
Boo I got too much cash for that
I never date rape I get too much ass for that
And do I walk around the streets broke 
Word up my money longer than the O.J. trial
Yo my Harlem World playas ya'll can shine with me
Got my own label now so ya'll can sign with me
Ya'll can take it from the bottom and climb with me
It's fine with me that's how it was designed to be
I'm in charge of all
Just threw a party at the Taj Mahal
'Cause The Mirage is small
We gonna build like construction real hot production
No playa hatin' just congratulatin'
And I'm known to taste a chick
Take her to my Harlem hideout and lace her quick
And believe me I know the right place to lick
As long as I got a face ya'll got a place to sit
I'm a true Don from here to Huston
Strong like a Yukon
No more jelly strictly Grey Poupon
Pretty ladies wanna see L
Fellas wanna be L
If I go to jail you'll wear shirts saying Free L
I'm comin through y'all with the Glock buckin'
Ya whole block duckin'
Every bitch that I'm fuckin' with now is cock-suckin'
It's like I'm allergic to not fuckin'
Ya niggas is faggots like Rock Hudson and Boy George
I destroy frauds with one verse
Nigga we could knuckle up
Or we could let the guns burst
L is the type to murder your son first
To get my point across
Since y'all wanna chit or chat with the coppers
Y'all might as well join The Force
Where I'm from believe me
Snitches get killed
Niggas be hustlin' daily
Tryna fuck more bitches than Wilt
Takin pictures in silk gator'd up
Passport dated up hair braided up
I fucked ya bitch
But I ain't rape the slut she gave it up
I runnin' with Wop you runnin' wit' me
We runnin' together
We get drunk and blunted together
But don't front the guns is under the leather
Ready to ill
Ready to kill ready to peel
Steppin to Corle' you better be real
'Cause none of my niggas be lettin' me chill
My crew be deliverin' hot lead
When gats are clenched rappers I clap and lynch
Nobody can fuck with the way
I be killin' up shit in rap events
It's like soon as I pick up a mic and start flowin'
The people yell
I'm rugged as hell brothers can tell
That none of y'all niggas is fuckin' with L
When I'm that nigga ya expect
To catch wreck on any cassette deck
I'm so ahead of my time
My parents haven't met yet

I walk around with six thou' sippin' on Cristal
My whole clicks wild I'm rich pal no more sticks I'm makin' hits now
What I recite you takin' hours to write
So if you bite just tell your man what kind of flowers you like
I'm about as ridiculous as bankrolls clothes and hostin' shows Smokin foes and strokin' hoes in the Poconos
I roll wit intruders looters and sharp shooters
Who spark Budhas And fuck thick bitches wit large hooters
I grew up in the slums of greed
Known for Drawin guns with speed or
Sellin' tons a weed 'cause I got sons to feed
Harlem's where the thugs rest in the slug fest
We sendin faggots all the way to heaven like Doug Fresh
I only roll wit big willie ass niggas
So motherfuck all them little silly ass niggas
I chew punks like chew sticks known for droppin' new hits
I know you want me ho if I was you I'd want me too bitch

That's how it runs money makin' in tons
Mansion swimmin' pool you know the rules
Champagne and brews flossin' my jewels
City zone mad game like pretty Tone
Hard as stone all Gruff cars got phones
Like Mob style smoking cigars and bones
Who be that Hundred dollar bills crispy
Versace suit slightly out to blaze and 
Gator morry sliding through the party mad pissy
Champagne cooler filled wit Mo Don and Cristy
Eyes low from the dutch and hydro
When bubbly get low what the fuck we buy mo'
I'm universal girls love Herb's style
Every now and then mix my herb wit' Tical

They hit me off wit mad loot plus the good punani
Now I'm mackin' Movado like I got half of the lotto
And be in Monte Carlo sippin' Remy out the bottle
Parle wit moms Alize in my palms
Stay calm send drug money to my baby moms
I don't know what it is or what they seen me wit
But these Moschino chicks want Casino chips
Mad bitches lickin' down my stomach like I'm Luke
While you wit' your team flippin' bricks to get your green
I whip the mean triple beam deluxe wit the wings
But real life that I could die over this cream
I ain't tryin' to be seen in jail with five to fifteen
So I change my ways start carryin' the Qu'ran
Follow the man that they call Louis Farrakhan
Soon as I stop dealin' drugs is a career
A thug appeared hit me wit a slug from the rear
It's fucked up but that what happens
When you dwell in these streets
Only two ways out the game
Go to jail or be deceased nigga

We's about to crush this cats out for justice
Crack yeah we crush this gats yeah we bust this
You got me i'm everybody wise copy
Without the Versace girls still flock me
And watch me five zero always tryna knock me and lock
But they know that they can't stop me
Perfect me check me rolling in the sexy
Edible sexible running from these federals
Catch me They never will 
Cam too incredible respectable
Pad locks dead cops mad rocks from mad blocks
Dead cops now we getting mad props
Creamy white girl saying that I'm dreamy
In made bikini claim they wanna see me
Used to ride the Beamy me and Muscolini
Bought em size jeanys when he came from the greens 
Mud shed when i'm in the Beam over bloodshed
Ride right cash jay go get our assay from Tucker's hookers
Yeah they should look this but when it's time pay
They gonn' say they shook us
Like Sandra Conda four pair of farmers
And mad ganja took her 
On my dick and another bitch fonder
But I wear two hats I don't wanna catch the monster
Get me hit me Motorola flippy
Wildness since bits ya'll cat's are kittens

Fuck them other cats I'm running with my own wolfpack
Keep frontin' like you's a thug and get your dome pushed back
'Cause you don't get down that tough shit you talk is profound you's a clown
Fuck around come uptown and get found
I keep a pocket full none of you niggas can touch my funds
I don't fight no more all I do is bust my guns
While you home relaxed I'm squeezing macs
Bustin' off caps those coward cats will go to platinum plaques get taxed
And I do jooks and sling pies to make cream rise
It's all about these green guys front your whole team dies
How I'm livin' so far swell you can't scar L
Headed a cartel selling more cakes than Carvel
And I'm labeled a kind thug police got my line bugged
Hope I see a grave from old age and not a nine slug
I'm quick to bust a mean nut in some teen slut
Big L is clean-cut with more jewels than King Tut
My clique is quick to put a bullet in a stranger's dome
You should have known not to roam through the Danger Zone
In Harlem is where the thugs rest in a slug fest
I'm sending faggots all the way to heaven like Doug Fresh
Big L grew up in the slums with greed known for drawing guns with speed
And selling tons of weed 'cause I got sons to feed
It's a must that my toast smokes I'm not like most folks
Fuck tens and twenties I carry ghost notes
And it's a must that I commence to slain
Any faggot MC who goes against the grain
I'mma smoke Pataki ass and Rudolph Giuli' like a wooly
I keep a tooly for any muli who act fooly
So if a nigga disrespect L to hell is where I'mma send 'em
After I skin 'em and spit some venom in 'em
I run with intruders looters and sharpshooters
Who spark buddhas and fuck thick bitches with large hooters
I'm the nigga that be jumping on your stereo
So when I walk the streets the bitches be tapping they friends like there he go 
I never had rules to follow none of my jewels are hollow
Try to take mines and you'll be on the news tomorrow
'Cause I never was the type to start beefs
But I spark creeps on dark streets and stop they heart beats
To hell with silly games I play survival sports
Sometimes I be in the crib stressed the fuck out with suicidal thoughts
All my life I been a lady bruiser a wrong chooser
School refuser drug abuser born loser
Clothes bummy nose runny it wasn't funny
A little dummy who tried to kill his mother for insurance money
Now me and the devil is on the same team
I'mma hit the mainstream with ill raps that's poison like gangrene
I'm better than every rapper that you thought was raw
Peace to all of my peoples out in Baltimore
I'm not a coward so fronting on me I won't allow it
I'm high powered fucking freak bitches like Adina Howard
Front get your belly torn I keep a Pelle on
I'm fucking with Grey Poupon and Dom Perignon
'Cause on the Avenue I pump rocks quick to give a chump knots
You ain't tough the only thing you shooting is jump shots
My style is hard like strong lumber cute chicks get the dick
And ugly bitches get the wrong number
I should have used a rubber before I went up in it
And then ya monkey ass won't be sittin in a clinic

Ayyo one hot summer night after ballin hard
I went to the phone booth with my callin card
And called up Joel yeah you know L
I told her come to the crib yo mother fuck a hotel
She said she was gonna come at ten
The bitch came but one problem she brought a friend
You know I'm not a rude brother yo
But I let Joel in and slammed the door on that other ho
So we was sittin in the livin room kickin it
And all I thought about was stickin it
She was mean 'cause you know I wouldn't fuck wit a sleazy ho
Yo we was coolin watching some TV show
I was crackin sex jokes tryin to get the puss'
And this bitch was kickin scripts beatin round the bush
Talkin bout rhyme for me L man fuck rhyming
'Cause my dick is hard enough to cut diamonds
I said I hope you ain't tryin to dick tease
'Cause Big L's quick to tell a bitch leave
My game started fuckin wit her head soon
Next thing ya know we went straight to the bedroom
I knocked the boots from New York to Santa Fe
And that bitch burnt me like a gamma ray
Ayyo I took it to the neighborhood clinic
Because she gave me gonorrhea
Yo I'mma kill that bitch the next time that I see her
One afternoon I was cruising on the Westside
Bumpin my system lounging back in a fresh ride
Hoes be hotter than a sauna
So I put the system on max and bumped my shit on the corner
I saw this girl walkin by who was hype as hell
She was mad point-blank she was right for L
But she tried to play me like a statue black
I ain't ask you that
She said in order to be with me you gotta be rich
You won't be able to switch I said Fuck you bitch
Another girl walked by I called her
Ayyo game I kicked well
I said honey my names Lamont but I'm known as Big L
I was looking smooth with the jewelry
Ayyo my pockets was extra thick
Yeah I bagged that ho well
Took her to the triple M movies meal and motel
And when it comes to this I'm a professor
I didn't molest her I caressed her undressed her then sexed her
But I must be getting bolder
'Cause I didn't put a helmet on my mother fucking soldier
I started stickin up quick
And the next time I took a leak
A motherfuckin flame shot out my dick

I drink Moet not Beck's beer I stay dressed in slick gear
Peace to my homies in the gangsta lean I see you when I get there
And it's a fact I keep a gat in my arm reach
I charm freaks and bomb geeks from here to Palm Beach
I'm puttin rappers in the wheelchair Big L is the villain
You still fear 'cause I be hangin in Harlem and my shit is for real here
If you battle L you picked the wrong head
I smash mics like cornbread you can't kill me I was born dead
And I'm known to pull steel trigs and kill pigs
I run with ill kids and real nigs who peel wigs
My rap's steady slammin I keep a heavy cannon
It's a new sherriff in town and it ain't Reggie Hammond

Now shit's constantly hot on my block it never fails to be gunshots
Can't explain a mother's pain when her son drops
Black male slipping in hail when will we prevail
Fearing jail but crack sales got me living well
And the system's suicidal with this Thug's Life
Staying strapped forever trapped in this drug life
God help me 'cause I'm starving can't get a job
So I resort to violent robberies my life is hard
Can't sleep 'cause all the dirt make my heart hurt
Put in work and shed tears for my dead peers
Mislead from childhood where I went astray
Till this day I still pray for a better way
Can't help but feel hopeless and heartbroke
From the start I felt the racism 'cause I'm dark
Couldn't quit the bullshit make me represent
Hit the bar and played the star everywhere I went
In my heart I felt alone out here on my own
I close my eyes and picture home

Aiyyo you betta flee Hobbes or get your head flown three blocks
L keep rapper's hearts pumpin like Reeboks
And every year I gain clout and my name sprouts
Some brothers'd still be vergins if the crack never came out
I got the wild style always been a foul child
My guns go boom-boom and yo' guns go wow-pow
I'm known to have a hottie open I keep the shottie smokin
Front and get half the bones in your body broken
And when it comes to gettin nookie I'm not a rookie
I got girls that make that chick Toni Braxton look like Whoopie
I run with sturdy clicks I'm never hittin dirty chicks
Got thirty-five bodies Buddy don't make it thirty-six

I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell another rock to sell
People look at you like youse the user
Selling drugs to all the losers mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray so you can reminisce
And wish you wasn't livin so devilish shit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin blunts with my crew flippin over sixty-two's
I got paid that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out no doubt
Then I figured out nicks went for twenty down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment and he wasn't tryin to hear it
Smoking mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court
For an assault that I caught in Bridgeport New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand 'cause man

Uh I learnt the game I know what I want and I'm in it
The time is now it's gonna be up in a minute
You look a bitch in the eye you could tell if he tinted
These fake rappers gettin by with these hell of a gimmicks
They act like it's all love only love is your money
So when it's over bitch are you a thug or a dummy
I'm neither but I been hot so long it feels like I got a lifetime fever
And I ain't gotta spit I could cough and still eat ya
And fuck rap I make mills of reefer
I'm a man first tired of punchin niggaz so I'mma shoot niggaz 'cause my hands hurt
And God is great guard ya space
One hand wash the other both wash the face
And I head crack so much it's hard to ace
Smith Wesson revolver flow its hard to trace what

Nigga I can see the coke in your nose
This ain't a movie even he got his head blown on the globe
And I was just about to find God
But now that Mase is back I think I'd much rather find a menage
And everybody talkin crazy how they're spit
But we know this investigatin and they ain't spray shit

Now we killin them hard niggas who said I must of found Pun's rhyme book
Got bitches on top of the Phantom
And the pinky got bling like the ring around Saturn
Cook coke crack niggas fiend for that
And you already know the x is where the team be at
I be puffin' blunts in the house hittin' stunts on the couch
This year crazy cats gon' get punched in they mouth
When your wife see me she don't know how to act
So don't be mad when I blow out her back For real
Your whole crew's a buncha poo butts made a few bucks
J'd a few sluts then ya'll started runnin' your lips a little too much
Got chedda to blow pockets never get low
Chickens sweat me wherever I go
Me and O.C. be in the Lex' Cartier specs Nautica sweats
Gore-Tex with Presidentials on full of baguettes
I done sold coke sold crack sold smoke sold smack
Now I wanna gold plaque can I get a soul clap 
Some cats be col' wack
You got the lye Well brother roll that
And if it won't get me high then hold that
I'mma cop me a six and cruise through the block with your trick
I'mma keep droppin' them hits it won't stop 'til I'm rich

Any mic I hold in the grip of my palm
I wave it over the crowd dictating shit like Genghis Khan
Nonchalantly deliver the flow like drug traffic
Scolding bringing somatic to this rap shit
Master the art so now I just flaunt it
Born to live a life and die but 'til then
I'mma keep on writing slick rhymes with the pen
I take the cherry from a beat like a virgin havin' innocent
Bust my nut bring rhyme to life like Genesis
Poetical renaissance endeavors are flawless
Tearing it up when it comes to me picking up this cordless
One of New York's finest
On this trip I coincide with Beatminerz
Bringing out the best in me
We formulatin' like a recipe
Water and dough we sho' 'nuff
Bestow my presence
Then I'm divine like the seven
Keeping it tight 'cause what I suffice is raw nigga

On the Blackout Rap show with my man Phat Phillie
We about to get into a verse like this

My cash flow was low I was low on dough
Used to try to talk to fly girls and they was like No 
I knew that all of that'd change once I started to blow
Now my pockets are bloated because I exploded
Stay devoted dropped a hot album now I'm loaded
I hang with fly stars buy cars for fifty-thou'
The New York City child thug with a pretty smile
I love this rap game that's why I married it
It's a big load but somebody gots to carry it
At one point I was about to give up
Then got offered a record deal and my eyes lit up
In nineteen ninety-two boo my dream came true
First I got the fame then the cream came through
Word up I used to rhyme all the time
I used to sell cracks now I sell tracks
Listen up 'cause when L raps he tell facts
I'm the type of cat to lay wack MCs to rest
I was told to work hard to achieve success
Words of wisdom from my father
He said L when things ain't going so well
Don't give up try harder
And never be afraid to make mistakes
And don't spend your cash foolishly save your papes
'Cause good things come to those who wait they turn
Stay concerned 'cause it's a lotta papes to earn
And help those that's less fortunate than you
And stay true to whatever you do until you're through

O.C.'s illin' I will never ever bore you
To rock like I do it takes certain zest
I'm truly untouchable like Elliot Ness
See my word and verse is fly
One moment tranquil then the next minute it goes with the strength to kill
I can rock a party right all night just trust me
Not an MC out there who can touch me
Anywhere I go young ladies they rush me
When I'm on the mic no way in hell you can hush me
My mere presence will leave you in awe
And when I'm through you too will call me papa
Now is the time to settle this vendetta
Slicin' MCs like a Swiss-cheese shredda
If you don't like Swiss then I cut you like chedda
Thick slow and quick great pain it will inflict
The beat's on time and the cuts all click
Elegant never meant I loves to invent
If you heard me say I rock this is what I meant
I don't shriek I speak I could never be weak
I got the crowd overwhelmed with my rap mystique
I'm shrewd never booed I wear the MC crown
When I step in the place MCs they bow down
Suckas I will smash they're not fit for the class
Yo when we get on the mic they break out like a rash
'Cause my sonic atomic MCs get moronic
Chillin' with Big L we like It's bionic
Charismatic emphatic bass has no static
Strungin' off the rhyme like a cocaine addict
Nothing but cheers call O.C. the leader
Def rhyme writer fake MC defeater
Girlfriend said you're sweet but I'm sweeter
I'll slay any MC in this rappin' arena
Colossal not a fossil MCs are quite docile
Teach what I'm preaching you can call me an apostle
Tall not short dog and this is the sport
I'm a soldier with the mic and I'm guarding my fort
And MCs are no bigger than my big toe
And I get higher rating than The Cosby Show
When I recite my rhyme just for you my friend
Big L jump on this mic and flow once again

Check it out bust it
Yo it's L the Harlem pimp baby
I got more dimes than that Sprint lady
Playa hatas be giving me harsh looks
But I'm tryin' to sell records like Garth Brooks
Yo it's L the Harlem pimp baby just like I said
Right now I'm going off the top of the head
It's me and O.C. we be low-key
Chillin' in the cribs iced-out Roley
Chillin' with my man his name is Phat Phillie
I'm about to get illy L is a willy
The Blackout Rap Show
I'm cool like my man Fat Joe
Chew MCs like tobacco

Who's the fatso No not O
MC pro-rap I can rip the show
With my man Big L that's right we representin'
Name is O.C. I'll put my foot indent in
Inside your butt like a slut on the call
Mics I storm
My man Big E is on the back of the side
MCs pull away before I crash your ride

Check it out check it out
O.C. I got your back bro

And we chillin' on the show called the Blackout Rap show
It's like that y'all
O.C. and L could never be wack y'all
Check it out every time I flow it's a sensation
Check it out like

I'mma set it off then you gonna set it off next

Watch how we flex

Right now we tourin' all over the world

MCs just dissin' your girl

Takin' MCs to schools and we ain't no fool

Right now we gonna make this the very last line

Ay yo Rookie is a game that a fool plays
I'm sitting here reminiscing about my school days
Ay yo I used to go mad fresh
Scoop the chick stupid prick get the digits and the address
Yo they was jocking 'cause I was clockin fast cash
I slid a chick everyday after last class
Strictly a sex thing let me explain
I hit 'em up get 'em up and put 'em on the next train
My trademark was black glasses I cut the whack classes
Then slide off with some cutie pies with fat 
Yo all the fellas was amazed
By the way I was macking females in my school days

Ay yo the school I went to a whole bunch rhymed
That's why it was battles everyday at lunch time
A brother battled me once it was plain whack
I played him so bad he left school and never came back
And in the lunchroom it was a Big L thing
I made so much noise that you couldn't hear the bell ring
One of us froze then dozed to the top I rose
And got props when I rocked the school talent shows
My opponents got scarred fast
That's why when they see me they do the hundred yard dash
I left emcees and they whole crew phased
Yea that's how I did it in my school days

When I first got inside high school I wasn't known
I roamed alone but I held my own
I was a freshman in other words a new jack
You see how it's all about me now

All the girls scream wow whenever I freestyle
When I roll the whole crews on the scenery
So those who envy me can't do a thing to me
I used to move alone now my crew's fat
I went from a new jack to a new mack that's true black
I'm cutting rappers like souffles I came off like toupees
Yea that's how I did it in my school days
I be a Harlem World party pleaser
That's where I rest at killin tracks is what I'm best at
Jealousy I expect that I don't stress that
I want a cutie with some tight jeans on that I can scheme on
Treat her nice take her out and trick some cream on
TV screens all over the U.S. I'm seen on
It ain't all about me I'm tryin to put my team on
Because it's good to have a crew to lean on mics I fiend on
You think you can do it like this Dream on
I'ma chrome my rims and ice my chain
Fly clothes and pretty hoes is the price of fame

Yo you know the game plan
C-Town that's my main man
We never bring luggage we go shoppin when the plane lands
Still run with the same clan used to be a Kane fan
Everything I rock is name brand
L'll make ya dame swallow
Your ice don't shine and your chain hollow
While you front in clubs for hours with the same bottle
Takin midget sips I run with the richest cliques
Tap the thickest chicks plus drop the slickest hits
You know nuttin about L so don't doubt L
What's this motherfuckin rap game without L 
Yo that's like jewels without ice
That's like china without rice
Or the Holy Bible without Christ
Or the Bulls without Mike
Or crackheads without pipes
The Village without dykes
Or hockey games without fights
Don't touch the mic if you unable to spit
Flamboyant is the label I'm with

I'm straight loco to hell with you and your broke ho
You ain't a big dog you more like Toto you got no dough
I smoke 'dro mixed with cocoa strong as bolo
Chips from here to Acapulco
While y'all buck for legs I buck for heads
I even buck celebs nigga fuck the feds

I stay sweatin out a bitch perm
I love it when a girl ass is fat and they tits firm
I take all the dough my chicks earn
I watched Corleone do it now it's Chris turn
Act illy get smacked silly with the mac-milli
You see me on MTV and Rap City
Keep frontin I'mma step out mask on with the tec out
Squeeze shots and make you check out

My underground niggas y'all can shine with me
Got my own label now so y'all can sign with me
Y'all can take me from the bottom and climb with me
That's fine with me that's how it was designed to be

I be that young teen with dumb cream
I refuse to be unheard or unseen I shine like the sunbeam
All you niggas better come clean before my gun scream
Rap's a fun thing only roll with one team
Flamboyant Entertainment that's who I came with
I pack a nine and once I aim it I got to flame it
Push a blue eight got props from here to Kuwait
And while your crew hate you hear me on Big L new tape
They call me C-Town I snatch mics like a rebound
Pack a three-pound that's my prerog' like B. Brown
I rip shows in large arenas like the Garden or Meadowlands
Got nuttin but love for all my ghetto fans
The Danger Zone is where pies get cut where all the guys get stuck
Try to front we gon' size you up
Like Corleone'll grab the chrome and throw five in your gut

Aiyyo gats we bust 
Only hot tracks we lust 
And we need plaques to touch 
'Cause half of you niggas that's rappin now

Y'all thought this was over with 
This ain't over with you
Yo what's the deal miss 
I'm sayin tho' let me know somethin right now
Y'know we been dancin all night
I been buyin you drinks all night and shit
You goin home with a nigga or what 
Tell me somethin Uhh
Whattup miss who you hidin wit 
Who you slidin wit Who you ridin wit 
Rent a room at the best 'tel
I make it last 'cause I sex well

Henn Rock and Alize I get drunk off
Whattup miss Get wit a real man and cut that punk off
E'rythang gon' be alright
I been watchin you watch me all night
I asked honey her name and she told me Celeste
She had big breasts honey had me harder than a Spanish test
We on the dancefloor gettin our boogie on
I see the haters watchin me with they hoodies on
Tryin to peep the ice under the sleeve
Took her to Ema G's  got some eggs and cheese
Grits fishcakes and orange juice freshly squeezed
When she finished her meal I said What's the deal
For real you goin home or you tryin to chill
She got close whispered somethin slow in my ear
And it ain't hard to tell where we goin from here

I ain't on that hatin stuff
I was feelin shorty then the bitch told me she was datin Puff
I'm a average nigga then she said she was in the 6
My relationship with that nigga called Jigga
I'mma compete with that I'm a corner nigga sellin crack
Guess I gotta be a ballplayin nigga to bone Da Brat
One bitch I ain't even wanna fuck
She runnin around all open off Kurupt
The ho I thought was gon' be real easy
Told me she got a man and he's some beatmakin nigga named Stevie
What's wrong with these hoes I'mma fly nigga
I don't wanna go flip Mo' to Rah Digga
Or Miss Lopez bitch no feds
She used to be in the Bronx rockin Pro Keds
With some Dominican 'dro heads ridin on top this
On the back titties all out 

Is yo' game rusty Around yo' dame never trust me
'Cause soon as you blink I'mma slide her off then bust three
And I only lay pipe to dimes
A lot of niggas I know are takin care of kids that might be mines
I love to go low I'm freaky like that
I never get caught creepin 'cause I'm sneaky like that uhh
It ain't my fault your girl be ho-hoppin
And matter of fact the last time you gave her loot to go shoppin
Honey picked me up some dope shirts
It's because of me why she's walkin crooked and her throat hurts
I hate to wait 'cause I'm not on the patient tip
Just hit me off we don't need a relationship
And when you mention my name it ring a bell
Ask any female nobody do it like L
I met this chick Rhonda who pushed the black Honda
Took her to the crib and bombed her with this big brown anaconda

Check it a year ago I did a show for some dough
Puffed a bag of hydro then broke out on the low
And on my way out it was a female on my trail
Who followed me from the stage to the Benz
I asked honey her name she replied Monique
Soft and sweet from her head to feet hotter than heat
Jump in the passenger seat let's go get something to eat
She said I was that Roc-a-Fella she'd been dying to meet
I tried to hit it first night she said she wasn't a freak
Yeah right it's all good so I waited a week
Then one night to my crib she decided to creep
Knocked on a nigga door and woke me outta my sleep
I let her in before you know it we was doing our thang
I drove her home and said tomorrow give me a ring
It was about a month later when she gave me a call
With some bogus ass story that was off the wall
Claiming she's pregnant with my child I think that's quite foul
How is that I wore a Lifestyle

Aiyyo fellas you gotta be careful today
Watch out for games that these females play
'Cause some break the rules and some don't play fair
You might get caught out there if you're not aware

I'm in the breed of the bad guy
Get caught in a mad lie come in your crib mad high
Think about me with the smile on your face
Think about me with my hand on your waist
And think about me with your hair in your face
Even caught a case fuckin witchu
Had said some ol' slick shit that had forced me to hit you
Had you set up livin swell how you gon' fuck my man L
Like we don't cross paths in these New York streets 
But that's good 'cause he's my man and we both shine
And to say we don't love these hoes is a old line
Honey just save some space in it so you can hold mine
Her whole spine be twisted 
Things she did and how she kissed it
I kinda missed it think back on how we dissed it
Now we two-fisted she ain't never resisted
Left it red and blistered shakin
I could slam it if it wasn't no money makin

Games these girls nowadays they play many
Techniques for getting your loot they got plenty
Suck the skin off your dick just for some ice and shit
In the beginning they're polite actin all nice and shit
But honey got plans to be pushing your Land
When she got you she goes and fucks your man
Understand you gotta lay down the law
A lot of broads is fraud they'll set you up Baby Pah
Some'll try to get you stuck up some'll fake pregnancy
Most are after the dough and the fame basically
Yo you can't make a ho a housewife kid
Pick the wrong chick could be a lifetime bid
A lot of cats be beefing over these honeys
Not me I keep it moving they ain't getting jack from me
Mack these freaks for your own enjoyment
And one love to L we gon' stay Flamboyant

Yo son you better watch these little fast-ass
Little fancy-pants bitches with the thongs
Heh that's my word
Yo rest in peace to my man Big L uhh
Peace to the God Sadat X

My crew be deliverin hot lead when gats are clenched
Rappers I jack and lynch
Nobody can fuck with the way I be killing the shit in rap events
Big L is the nigga you expect
To catch wreck in any cassette deck
I'm so ahead of my time my parents haven't met yet
I'm feeling like Billy Bathgate
My rap style is past great
I love to fuck a bitch from the back and watch her ass shake
I probably got your mommy strung
Niggas hear me and take more notes than Connie Chung
My clan plans to get Guillianni hung
Never had a gassed head
Got loot 'cause I stash bread
Try to tax and I'mma beat your fagot ass half-dead
I stomp white cops till the life stops
For a low price hops
'Cause my blood is colder than an ice box
'Cause my crew will kill a nigga from the lobby to the top floor
And every time a mack eleven bucks
I'm killing at least seven ducks
I never was a follower of Reverend Butts
The bitch type I dislike I'm rougher than a fist fight
All chicks ain't shit ain't no such thing as Ms. Right
So we can never be a couple hun
Fuck love all I got for ho's is hard dick and bubble gum
And clown emcee's I be attacking quick
I'm on some rappin shit and some car jackin shit
I ran up on this nigga name Mac in a black ac
And put the gat to his cap click-clack
Sorry jack but get up out of that
My Smith Wesson works great so make a mistake and hesitate
I can't wait to demonstrate this nickel plate
He didn't listen to what I was speakin
He started reaching
So I left him sleepin with his temple leaking
Aight back to my man Jay-Z
 
As soon as I grab it I eat it up like a savage
And no I don't have it I get it together like a marriage
I'm seeking all rappers I'm on my p's and q's and carrots
Y'all don't understand well goddamn don't you know my status
I'm flowing the fattest  that is  I'm the baddest
No need to explain my name the only thing that matters
For suckers who bite me they find I'm a bit much to swallow
Your thinking that's hollow the rhythm is too rugged to follow
Let me take a little breathgod damn
The kid is a wizard
I'm definitely destined to make eight digits
Met up with L on the road to riches
As soon as I step up nah whenever I'm in the uh
Whatever I touch whatever I clutch
You know I'm gonna end ya uh
The nigga don't play hey the nigga don't play hey
Niggas are do ducking I'm boo buckin fuck it I'm whyle
I see you brought your little crew  and
I'm still comin with velocity check it out
Ain't none of the clowns fuckin around
Ain't none of clowns standing their ground
With the crowned prince of the underground
Sounds like I'm ready to catch wreck now
The heats on sweat now
Jay-Z's on be gone to the next town
Punk jump up and get beat down
Check it out check it out check it out
Ladies be comin out of their seats now
Shit I got crazy skills
It's a pity the way I'm ripping rugged rhythm through the city
I got rhythm I hit em with rhythm I
Hit em and split em I did em I get rid of them guys
Talkin' about the lyrics that he have are hot
Step to this and get lit like a candle troop
Rhymes I hook up MCs I cook up
Like Campbell's Soup
I throw rhymes like a quarterback
Front and you'll get bust an' dust and crushed
Bum rushed and all of that
Rhymes never sound whack
'Cause I got 'em down pat
Your rulin' time is over
So gimme your crown jack
I get hype fast
And mines are heavy like a big brick
Rappers catch a fit quick
When I start to kick shit
And I record my battles on a camcorder
So I can sit back and watch me manslaughter
MCs that tried to get wit' me hops
That's why they all got tooken out like a Bensi box
The crown is still mine 'cause I kick ill rhymes
A lotta rappers talk that murder shit and couldn't kill time
Or beat eggs or whip cream
I'm smoother than Vaseline
And I'm a stone cold rappin' fiend
A lot of new jacks are comin' out but that's cool
'Cause I'm the principal of the new school
I recite hype rhymes that shine like rainbows
I pick up the microphone and play MCs like game shows
And suckas are coppin' pleas while I'm clockin' gs
Try stoppin' these lyrics nigga please
'Cause my rhymes are ill like a kid with a bad cold
Your style is mad old you're small as a tadpole
This is a giant here an MC rap pioneer
Before you battle me chief go throw on your riot gear
I'm hardcore comin' outta wars jus' barely bruised
Makin' MCs go on strike like the daily news
But there aren't gonna be any comebacks
Sayin' them bum raps your lyrics are dumb whack
I wreck shows and explode like a landmine
'Cause L kicks the deadliest shit known to mankind
Front on me you'll be history like last week
'Cause rappers be frontin' hard and booty like ass cheeks
I'm hotter than Florida
I gets raw with a mic
Slammin' niggas like the Ultimate Warrior
The subject the predicate
L kicks better shit
Couldn't get passed me if your homeboy set a pick
Try to play me out like a cub scout
Better get the fuck out my face
Or get placed in a casket
It'll be a tragic incident
What a coincidence
My rhymes are infinite like math
And I go to work in a suit fool
'Cause I'm the principal of the new school
The lyrics that I'm kickin' are like lethal weapons
Every time that I pick up a mic I see you steppin'
'Cause you want no parts of the L
Hear the sound of my voice ya start bitin' your fingernails
'Cause you're petro and my lyrics are death so
Could you win a battle against me Heck no
I just cruise and get smooth on the rap tip
Go ahead bite my lyrics and get a fat lip
Or a broken jaw you'll get more than a beatin' troop
Fuck around you'll be eatin' soup
'Cause I'm a brother who likes to party hard
Nice with my hands so I don't need a bodyguard
MCs be walkin' the streets jus' col' frontin'
Step to this and get beat like you stole somethin'
'Cause I'm not the man to be step to
I won't let you ruin my reputation across the whole nation
Rappers that be basin' I'm choppin' like Jason
I kick so much flavor you should call me the flavor man
Here take my autograph 'cause you're a major fan
Of the L 'cause you like the way I'm kickin' flavor
Hot as an oven but cool as a refrigerator
MCs be bitin' my lyrics like a stone thief
Believe me chief you want no beef
So give those lyrics back to the right owner
Or get beat until ya fall in a coma
And physical contact you don't want that
So gimme what's mine and there'll be no harm jack
'Cause where I'm from we don't like that thief shit
And I'm the last rapper who you wanna beef wit'
'Cause chumps I overrule
I'm invincible and the principal of the new school
Yo while we hold gats you hold knives
And when you sold eighth's we sold pies
And when you rode bikes we drove 5's
There's no comparison son s'just embarrasing
I'm runnin' wit some of da baddest men in the whole New York
We hold the fort while you crab cats is holdin tips
Playa hatin pushin stolen whips
We at da dice game rollin trips out of town throwin bricks
Taking over cooking up coke with baking soda
You betta spread wit them thirty dollar kicks on
Or get whipped on knocked out cold and pissed on
L is a heavyweighter wit steady paper
You da type to go to jail for a petty caper
Then come home on good behavior
Talkin bout u no longa hard now 'cause u a man of god now
Yo its amazing L is blazing always been
Before i put da braids in i use to let the waves spin
What u be sayin dont impress me at all
And them chicks u be jayin dont be sexy at all
Word life everything that i recite stand out
Go head and front so i can try this right hand out
Across yo jaw L neva lost a war
No respect for them cowards who enforce tha law
You got sumthin to say then cough it out
'Cause cowards be wantin beef but when u pull out the heat
They ready to talk it out
What is there to talk about u was just frontin
Now it ain't nuttin ain't that suttin
I should start bussing anyway
And put one of u punks in da ground
Ya'll cowards be killin me wit ya'll faces frown jumpin around
Like u scaring L not even 'cause I'mma be a thug until i stop breathin
Plus I'm runnin with a smooth ass crew that'd shoot at u
You wanna knuckle up whateva we can do that too
Ya'll fellas like to stress them chicks impress them chicks
Spend money to dress them chicks i sex them chicks
Then send them home corleone is known to be stoned
When i bone i rubber duck in case that chick full blown
The other night around 8pm pockets crazy slim
Took a thou' out later on i had to wild out
In da club knock some coward and his pal out
Then afterwards went to the restroom pissed Cristal out
Now im thinkin what chick number i can dial out
'Cause its L the harlem pimp baby for real
I got more dimes then that sprint lady and thats ill
Playa haters be givin me harsh looks but im tryna sell records like Garth Brooks
So f em all when its cold i throw the skelly on
Illegal chips keep my celly on mega ice is what im heavy on
If it ain't Cristal boo i guess its Perignon
If the na-na's too tight i throw some jelly on
Yo try to tax and watch the 9 mil burst
I've been off the scene over 3 years and cats is still thirst
They hear Big L drop a ill verse so all you unsigned cats that wanna battle get a deal first
I sport da bulletproof fitted-hat that attitude you betta get rid of that
Whereava u floss is where u gon get it at
I stay strapped i go to sleep wit my steel
Makin figures while u broke cats keepin it real
I rob fags in da staircase no mask bare face
The one police wouldn't dare chase keep my gear laced
Do I walk around without papes No way pal
Word up my money longer than the OJ trial
Aiyyo I should have been out I'm deadly when I pull the pen out
Keep frontin' almost tried yo' chin out
I knocked a lot of men out
I left em on the floor spittin' phlegm out
It's either that or I'mma squeeze the gat and pop ten out
You see Corleone ice spinnin' jigged out white linen
And if a bitch don't like me she must like women
Everytime I come around you see your wife grinnin'
Don't be mad 'cause your career's in the ninth inning
It's over now nigga leave the game
I'm from the Danger Zone where MC's get slain
Where thugs that never hesitate to squeeze the flame
Where niggas be takin' drugs just to ease the pain
Hustlers flip cokey fourty-eight Hours like Nick Nolte
When I was OT your bitch wrote me
First day home I dived in it left her thighs dented
Now that bitch be pagin' me every five minutes
MC's I squash and disgrace
It's all about the Benji's so why your bills got Washington's face 
A lot of cats be frontin' mad singles wit a fifty on top
L tryin' to have the city on lock
Peace to Biggie and Pac 'cause they really were hot
Rap game heavy hitters it's a shame they no longer wit us
Niggas wanna be L ladies wanna see L

Aiyyo I hear a lot of bitch in your talk
See a lot of switch in your walk
Only thugs get rich in New York
Because they sick of all this drag queen shit
Your wife missin' I'm the nigga see was last seen wit
Me and Ron hit it up on some tag team shit
A bunch of niggas got smoked for the cash
Used to ride Greyhounds wit dimes hoes who stuffed the coke in they ass
Crazy beefs got provoked in the past lot of wigs got split
A lot of innocent kids got hit
Harlem World be the place of my birth
Believe me son we breed the smoothest niggas on the face of the earth
Mics I steadily smoke rhymes cleverly wrote
As long as I can rock a crowd I'mma never be broke
Some hoes treated me like a bumb nerd when I was unheard
Now I'm icey I ain't gotta say one word you dumb bird
I push whips while you walk all day
And I hate when strange niggas wanna talk all day
Clown ass shit hate to be around that shit
When I was at the steakhouse pullin' cake out
You was at some cheap Chinese shit gettin' take out
How you make out you take the fake route
You oughta break out
You couldn't get a bitch before you put your tape out what 

Yo I be that smooth cat you never seen rollin' with clowns
One of the few from Uptown that's holdin' it down
Bitches be on me like I'm welfare
Even rich whores that live in Bel Air
Is this Big L Yeah hell yeah
Word up I use a chrome gat to push domes back
Watch how you talk when you call me Feds got my phone tapped
This rap game I put my life in it
Chain got mega ice in it
Push an Infinite chrome rims light-tinted
And you can see pal it's all about me now
Twenty G's a show bitch three thou' just to freestyle
I made this cheese it didn't grow on trees
Can you hold somethin' Sure you can hold on these
Yo I'm fat like a old Cray-on smooth as Rayon
L is who the ladies stay on baby play on
I stay jeweled up pockets swelled up
From banks I held up
Plenty bitch-ass niggas Big L stuck
I never catch cold feet when I hold heat
We roll deep in the triple black dark-tinted jeep
I catch a fag three o'clock in the morn'
On the block all alone
And put a Glock to his dome
Tell him Give it up quick you nitwit don't try to get slick
Or I'mma let this four-fifth spit and leave your shit split
Prick it ain't nothin' decent about me
A true thug for real you can ask the precinct about me
A rap junky don't try to play me like some flunky
Jewels be chunky pockets lumpy attitude grumpy
And mad niggas be frontin' a lot
Poppin' mad shit tryin' to be somethin' they not
Your faggot ass better stick to dancin'
Don't even look at me I might break your jaw just for glancin'
I'm sick like Manson
In nineteen ninety-seven Harlem kids is blowin'
And we don't trick we'll let a bitch starve 'til her ribs is showin'
Word check it out check it out check it out
MCs get taught a lesson
When the mic is in my possession
Rap's my profession L is nice no question
It's a fact I stay geared It shouldn't be weird
That I'm feared 'cause my raps are rougher than a nappy beard
I cook rappers like a chef
I'm Def like Jef right to left
My raps are badder than morning breath
With niggas deaths I'm the number one suspect
'Cause I catch much wreck 'specially when I'm upset
Suckers I'm a stiggedystar breaking them up and then taking they heart
You better believe that Big L is the man that be ripping the microphones apart
I hold the forty right because I'm the naughty type
When I strike the mic niggas be like shorty hype
I'm smoother than Velvet my lyrics is well writ'
You saying L's this and L's that get off L's dick
Rhymes I create a knock out ya gold tooth
Battling me is like fightin' a gorilla in a phone booth
I wreck mics and drop the cool speeches
Nowadays rappers think they motherfuckin' schoolteachers
One two one two rappers I run through
Fuck Karate I practice Gun-Fu
The Big L is an assassinator
I grab the Mag and leave a fag leakin' like activator
I'm the nigga that you never even thought of beatin'
Black white or Puerto Rican
I'm gonna slaughter each and
Every crab MC that runs up
When a battle comes up give me two thumbs up

What's up boo how you do 
I've been watching you and you don't have a clue and this ain't nothin new
Come to the crib I got a beautiful view
And a heart-shaped water bed made for two
Uhuh I do my thing when it's humping time
So all you cuties that wanna bump and grind jump in line
Let me zoom in the boom like Wreckx
When I'm through your nets
Cos I'm a fiend when it comes to sex
Of course you knew that
I'd give you the world but trick my ends I don't do that
I'm ready to get my flirt on
One honey with the skirt on
She got knees that I would love to put some dirt on
Come here shorty let's drink a forty and get naughty
Go get your crew I'll go get mine and let's make it an orgy
And if you wanna be my girl just forget it
It's just room to hit it

So all my ladies are you with me where you at 
Let me hit it from the back and tell you if it's good or wack
When I'm all alone I call honey's on the phone
And Tell 'em come see me but if we ain't gonna bone then keep your ass home
I used to mate with this honey Kate
The sex was great
Her shape would make a sweet playa turn straight
When you mention my name it rings a bell
Ask any female nobody does it like L
That's why the ladies wanna meet me discreetly
Cos I'm freaky and love to go deep sea
Fishing I be caressing em' strickly sexing em'
You know my style I'm Down with O.P.P. like Treach and em'
I get the woman loose quicker than gin and juice
Sometimes I wanna jiggy to sporting gators and linen suits
And if you wanna be my girl just forget it
I'm not with it  
It's just room to hit it

Around your girl you shouldn't trust me
Cos soon as you turn your back I'mma slide her off then bust three
And I only lay pipe to dimes
A lot of brothers I know are taking care of kids that might be mines
I love to go low I'm freaky like that
I even hit my mans girl 'cause I'm sneaky like that 
It ain't my fault your girl me ho-hoppin'
And matter fact the last time you gave her loot to go shopping
She picked me up some dope shirts
It's because of me why she's walking crooked and her throat hurts
I hait to wait 'cause I'm not on a patient tip
Just hit me off we don't need a relationship
I practice safe-sex so I keep the latex
Looking through the Rolodex to see who I'mma slay next
And if you wanna be my girl just forget it
It's just room to hit it
Yo I'm the one who made you get on the dance floor
And shake 'til your pants tore so party people clap your hands for
The one they call Big L
I'm hot as hell I'm livin' swell
My name's ringin' bells can't ya tell 
So grab the Moët and take a sip
I stay lookin' dip mics I rip but don't flip
We on the party tip
I get so loose on tracks that I produce
MCs be frontin' mad hard but got no juice
I'm not the type that strikes out when I pull mics out
Violate L and it's lights out
And if you got no skills on the mic you oughta dash
'Cause rappers that're sorta trash the Big L slaughter fast
I'm gettin' high rates in all states makin' papes with the crew called
Diggin' in the Crates 
I'm a rap crowd amazer microphone dazer Big L is the man with the unexpected flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Big L is the man with the unexpected flava
Now when I'm on the stage microphones I lock tight
The Big L rock right when I'm in the spotlight
Yo I'm a young dapper rapper that dress well
Foes I expel the ladies wanna sex L
Because my raps are real raw
I'm hard as a steel door with skills most MCs'll kill for
I'm known for grabbin' the mic and then droppin' a raw rhyme
Big L's the greatest of all times so gimme my props I want all mines
Battles I refuse to lose I chose to cruise smooth like the blues
I never hear boos 'cause I abuse
In nineteen ninety-three I'm blowin' up like dynamite
And don't think I can't fight because I'm kinda light
L's a teenage poet that men fear
Chief to be sincere you got no wins here
I play MCs like a game of Sega
'Cause I'm poetic and this is the unexpected flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Big L is the man with the unexpected flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Big L is the man with the unexpected flava
Now I'm gonna kick flave 'til the microphone's broke
And I'm known to do the wild thing like Tone-Loc
I screw whores I do tours I'm smooth like Lou Rawls
I write raps that hurt MCs like blue balls
In all zip codes the Big L rip shows
You couldn't touch this if you was on your tip toes
I live in the ghetto and rap is my route out
Now I'm on wax givin' my crew a shout out
Since I'm paid I could knock any ho' boots
But L wasn't so cute when I had no loot
Now I'm lookin' slick and my pockets are thick
I need surgery to get chicks removed from my dick
Ayyo my cards I'm playin' well
Picture that a rapper slayin' L No way in hell
My rap skills are sharp like a razor but don't sweat it
This is the unexpected flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Big L is the man with the unexpected flava
Once again it's the man with the flava
Big L is the man with the unexpected flava
I got some new shit for y'all to play to ya know 

This is the frosted flakes right here

This is the Lord Finesse beat

Aight I guess  it will work it will work

You can get jiggy with that 

Yeah let me see check it out

You can ball with this

About to get into some shit
Yo fuck all the glamours and glitz I plan to get rich
I'm from New York and never was a fan of the Knicks
And I'm all about expandin my chips
You mad 'cause I was in the van with your bitch
With both hands on her tits
Corleone hold the throne that you know in your heart
I got style plus the way that I be flowin is sharp
A while back I used to hustle sellin blow in the park
Countin G stacks and rockin ice that glow in the dark
Forever hottie huntin trigger temper I'm quick to body somethin
You lookin at me like I'm probably frontin
I fuck around and throw three in your chest and flee to my rest
I'm older and smarter this is me at my best
I stopped hangin around y'all 'cause niggas like you
Be prayin on my downfall hopin I flop
Hopin I stop you probably even hope I get locked
Or be on the street corner with a pipe smokin the rock
I got more riches than you fuck more bitches than you
Only thing I haven't got is more stitches than you
Fuckin punk you ain't a leader what nobody followed you
You was never shit your mother should have swallowed you
You on some tagalong flunkie yes man shit
Do me a favor please get off the next man dick
And if you think I can't fuck with whoever put your money up
Put your jewels up no fuck it put your honey up
Put your raggedy house up nigga or shut your mouth up
Before I buck lead and make a lot of blood shed
Turn your tux red I'm far from broke got enough bread
And mad hoes ask Beavis I get nuttin Butt-head
My game is vicious and cool
Fuckin chicks is a rule
If my girl think I'm loyal then that bitch is a fool
How come you can listen to my first album
And tell where a lot of niggas got they whole style from 
So what you actin for 
You ain't half as raw you need to practice more
Somebody tell this nigga sum'un before I crack his jaw
You runnin with boys I'm runnin with men
I'mma be rippin the mics until I'm a hundred and ten
I throw slugs at idi-ots no love for city cops
I sport a pretty watch eight-hundred and fifty rocks
I'm makin wonderful figures
I don't fuck with none of you niggas
I might pull out this gun on your niggas
And rob every last one of you niggas
Aight let me kick some more shit one more time
Aight we gone hit it like this check it out
Yo check it yo my shit is hot like jerk chicken I should rob you
But with that cheap shit you ain't worth stickin'
I've got a left hook that be leavin' guys knocked out
Keep frontin' and I'm a choke you till your eyes pop out
I was taught that if a nigga swing
You swing right back
Battle Corleone why do a stupid thing like that 
Yo I'm not in the mood son so don't push me tonight
Plus I fucked your little sister and that pussy was right
That pussy was tight grippin' my dick like a pair of pliers
You fuckin' snitch right now you prolly wearin' wires
It's not a joke so as soon as he laugh
I'm a strip him naked and stick a long broom in his ass 
Leave him heart-broken make him quit rap and start smokin'
My album is done so no it ain't no parts open
I'm not a sweet stud I'm a street thug
That's quick to beat a nigga like a cheap rug till he leak blood
You sure soft watched you fall off might slide your whore off
Then call all off and tear your jaw off
My life is far out I got star clout
Every week bring a different car out go to clubs and buy the bar out
You ain't a player put that cigar out
Take that suit off before I shoot off and tear your roof off
Leave your clothes bloody-red like the nose of Rudolph
I rocked many stages and never got booed off
I might let this gat burst put you in a big black hearse
For that wack verse should have tried these other cats first
'Cause none of y'all niggas can fuck with me
And if your man wanna join I got McGruff with me
I do shit that only tough men do
And them cats you with fuck them too I'll buck them too
Be careful what you rush into you lame-ass nigga
No dough always on the train-ass nigga
You got fucked upstate you cupcake
How many dicks can your butt take 
I ran through every bitch in my path
I was fuckin' chicks in the ass when I was six-and-a-half
Yo I'm a take you out your misery 
And after this nigga put you in the social study book 'cause you're History

I used to be a rich nigga selling much crack
To make a long story short I fell off like a hub cap
My operation got shut off
I can't slide a slut off
I gotta beat my dick to get a nut off
'Cause when a convo is struck up
Bitches act stuck up my luck sucks everything is fucked up
To get cash I gotta beg
'Cause every time I reach in my pocket all I feel is my damn leg
Its about time that I feel cash gotta get it right now gotta get it real fast
'Cause all I got left is 2 mack tens a army jacket a ski mask a hoodie and some black Tims
I'm about to get extra ill so I went to my crib got booted up and got dressed to kill
The first place that I hit was the corner store
I pulled out and told everybody to get on the floor
I took the cash and I jetted
One kid tried to set it I bet he regret it 'cause because he got wetted
Robberies I did well when you look in the dictionary under villain you'll see a photo of Big L
Fuck a job punks is gettin robbed and scarred
'Cause times is hard on the boulevard

Yo I was robbing people on a regular basis in many different places and all types of races
I robbed gangstas I robbed ducks I didn't care who I stuck as long as I got a buck what the fuck
When niggas see me they take flight
I'll even rob Jehovah if I catch him right on a late night
Keep a vest G don't try to test me
A red neck police chief tried to arrest me
Ayo that wasn't a smart cop
Because I put 2 in his chest and his motherfucking heart stopped
Its a must I commit crimes
'Cause I gotta get mine its hard times and all I see are dollar signs
Why should I work for another sucker
When I can do robberies and make G's like a motherfucker
Fuck a job punks is getting robbed and scarred
'Cause times is hard on the boulevard

Yo I was goin out just like a crusader would
I robbed everything that moved in the neighborhood
Yo I was even robbing chicks
I did mad sticks I needed more dough so I started taking hits
Blastin ducks with the shotty
The trigger I squeeze with ease I got paid fifty g's per body
In a year I killed eighty eight
So I made about fuck it I was crazy straight
Fuck a job punks is getting robbed and starved
'Cause times is hard on the boulevard
This goes out to all the wolves
Hah in the streets and in jail
Yeah yo it's your man Big L
I got my man Tommy Gibbs and Corleone with me
Check it out uhh bust it
Aiyyo I just left the studio and it's about two in the morn'
Just finished doin a song
Now I'm ready for sleep
But first I want spaghetti to eat
And it's a good Italian restaurant right up the street
So I jumped in the Jeep stash the heat under the seat
Then I got a beep my voice is hoarse barely can speak
I called back on the cell it's Corle' mad as hell
Told me to listen well as he started to yell

I control the microphone like a robot
My lyrics are so hot props I got a whole lot
'Cause wit' a pen and some paper this man makes
Rhymes that're so damn great with flavor like pancakes
I'm kickin' rhymes like a game of kickball
I'm rough like a brick wall MCs take a big fall
For tryin' to get with this I'm too swift with this
A microphone murderer full with magnificence
A def rapper and also a swell one
In a battle I cook MCs well done
My hits are consecutive
I'm a lyrical executive
Bite my rhymes and I won't let you live
So to be safe on the microphone homes
Recite your own poems or get your dome flown
Or put in a boot camp L is the new champ
I'm not the type to go out like a food stamp
I'm throwin' rhymes like a pitcher throws a curve ball
And I'm a serve all punks that try to brawl
So stop sleepin' on me don't even doze hops
Or I'm a heat you up and eat you up like Stove Top
Stuffin' I'm bum rushin' shorts I'm takin' none
My rhymes weigh a ton I'm not fakin' son
You're the one who's fakin' tryin' to be a duplicate
Can't kick stupid shit tell you the truth you should quit
Rappin' start snappin' 'cause all you is a joke
Battle L and get smoked
Yo I overthrow ya and have ya screamin' like a rollercoaster
Guzzle you down like a small cup of Coca-Cola
I'm goin' through MCs like a ransack
Your rhymes are rusty g you can't fuck with me
That's why you're hidin' in protective custody
L's not the one and I keep MCs runnin'
I hurt 'em like bunions make 'em cry like onions
I'm a lyrical fighter and I'm brighter than Einstein
Try to bite my lines and you'll get a size nine
Foot put in your ass for bein' a crook
Hit with a vital hook and get your title took
Yeah I'm a pass it to my man

Now check it out I'm a get paid for the nineteen nineties
I don't care who likes me or who stands behind me
The man to peep far from weak so don't sleep
From stage to streets I still go one deep
So save that off the wall bullshit ya get had son
Fuck around grab the mic and catch a bad one
I come correct and strapped to bust a ill rap
Me take a loss to who Ya oughta kill that
Back up slack up give a brother some head room
Hype on the mic amazin' in the bedroom
Girls like me 'cause I'm straight and don't sidestep
I do shit Jack LaLanne ain't tried yet
Ask any female bet you she'll say I'm good
That's why I'm Finesse porn star of the neighborhood
Yeah 'cause I kick slicker raps
It's Lord Finesse so bow and tip your hat
And make way 'cause I get plenty say
And those who don't like me I don't give a shit anyway
'Cause when it comes to lyrics I always find somethin'
That make brothers press the rewind button
I'm a get mine tell me what you're gonna do 
'Cause ya couldn't see me if ya wanted to
Get who you want shit you could call the cops
But for now I'm gettin' all my props

So chill don't try to get ill dummy
Me get stomped by who Be for real money
I'm not havin' it so go on and get your best group
You'll see why they call me Lord Finesse troop
I eat 'em like sandwiches send 'em home in bandages
Gimme that mic I'll show you what doin' damage is
Nice swift and deeper than quicksand
I'm takin' out opponents like a hit man
I get the crowd hype like a sorta drug
It's Lord Finesse who the fuck you thought it was 
I lounge and chill but still could get ill
I'm live and real with skill beyond skill
Pull girls like a lasso keep the crazy cash flow
A nigga beat me on the mic Don't be an asshole
I'm indestructible so bring in a substitute
What's up with a battle Yo I can't fuck with you

I'm intellectual gettin' the best of you
I eat MCs like the food at a festival
Drop science and math stand tall like a giraffe
Completin' thetask breakin' rappers in half
Puttin' suckers out of it yeah I talk a lot of shit
But when it comes to rhymes I deserve a fuckin' scholarship
Won't front or perp the role I get the most of hoes
I'm so cool I've got pussy on remote control
Whether you're a virgin or a bad lookin' hot sister
I'm baggin' up bitches like a shoplifter
So Lord Finesse is not the one to fool
I was gettin' sex since they first invented Underoos
So set it off no time to rehearse the rappin'
It's Lord Finesse so prepare for the worst to happen
Mics get ripped up good times get tucked
Throw your hands in the air suckers keep your lips shut
'Cause ya'll wanna waste time sayin' them fake rhymes
Gimme my respect and props or I'm a take mine
'Cause I ain't nothin' to play with
And fuckin' with me ya need more than a first aid kit
So it's better that ya chill and max with me
I'm sendin' out warnin's quicker than a fax machine
I get funky and kick it so let's get wit' it
Opponents who think they can hang y'all can forget it
I sit and write rhymes makin' up hype lines
Achievin' shit you couldn't do in a lifetime
So don't care me and compare me to those other brothers
I'm Lord Finesse and I'm one bad ass muthafucker
I'm doin' MCs as ya hire 'em
Bustin' they ass and make 'em sign up for retirement
Without doubt I'm a brother with all the clout
Whoever said I'm whack what the fuck is they talkin' about 
Yeah you don't stop so L my man my brother
Tear shit up you bad muthafucker

Yo I'm the microphone murderer
And I'm known for bustin' mad caps
I was in rag tracks with rhymes that backslap
'Causin' a nightmare I don't fight fair
Niggas playin' hard rock hopin' they might scare
You're tryin' to take your idol's title
You on some bugged shit
I keep the women fiendin' and screamin' for my smooth shit
My rhymes are mad thick and yours is thin as a pool stick
Fuck it bust it I like it rough and rugged
Your style is wick whack and played out like nugget
Bracelets face this you can't erase this escape this
Break this take this 'cause I bake this
I get so loose on beats that I produce
Niggas be frontin' crazy hard and got no juice
They softer than paper plates the lyrics I make is great
A few sheets of loose leaf and a Erasermate
Is all I need to write rhymes that are extra fly
Mics I wreck and fry rappers I petrify
Pack a fo' fif' with eight shots
With one you get popped
And now you're locked in a box dead with no props
I'm not jokin' there's no time for snappin'
Niggas that be yappin' I'm puttin' caps in
So base up or get sprayed up to the waist up
You'll get found faced up police can't trace up
Fingerprints why Because I leave no evidence
Big L's the name one three nine is the residence peace
You don't want zero problems big fella 

Ooh watch me come and put the hinges in their hands
Countin' Benjis while we meetin' make 'em shake my other hand
Milly rockin' scoopin' all the blessings out my lap
Bitch I know you tried to cheat you should have never took a nap hey
Fuck wrong with you What you were thinkin' 
Fuck you thought it was 
You talk that talk that make a lame ass nigga fall in love
Not me though bitch you can keep those
Bruh I'm at your head like Craig did Deebo
Don't tweak bro it's never sweet ho
My shooters come for free so

You old Petey Pablo take your shirt off
Wave 'round your head like a helicopter
I ain't put enough weed in the blunt
All you do is smoke tobacco
Where the hell you get them from 
Yeezy said he ain't make them
My niggas chasin' bounty hunters
And gettin' chased by their baby mommas
My first tat was on my stomach
Got a pocket full of money
And a mind full of ideas
Some of this shit may sound weird
Inside of the Maybach
Look like it came out of Ikea
Run shit like diarrhea
Big yacht no power steering

I got problems bigger than these boys
My deposits they be on steroids
Lord free the Carter niggas need the Carter
Sacrificin' everything I feel like Jesus Carter
Hold up I got this sewed up my soda poured up
My woes up I'm flippin' those bucks they doing toe tucks
I rolled up and let the smoke puff
I lay down toes up
Hold up get too choked up when I think of old stuff
Move on put my goons on they kidnap newborns
In the streets my face a coupon
Her pussy too warm
All these bitches come to do harm
Just bought a new charm
Fuck the watch I buy a new arm you lukewarm
I'm Uncle Luke with the hoes
Pretty bitches centerfolds
Tippy toes around my crib in they robes just their robes
Half a milli' in the safe another in the pillowcase
Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race
Fuck wrong with you What you were thinkin' 
What you thought it was 
I just popped five Percocets and only caught a buzz
And if that label try to stop me
There gon' be some crazy Weezy fans waitin' in the lobby

Okie dokie alkie keep it lowkey like Thor lil bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote wilding like that coyote
If I sip any Henny my belly just might be outie
I just opened up the pack in an hour I'll ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling fuck me
Two weeks she'll be yelling fuck me
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy Tommy and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas Jesus pieces sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh generation above me I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddy's y'all taught me how to go hunting 

I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go everywhere they be asking how's it going
Say the going's well go figure Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell all praise to the God
Check check mate check me take me to the bedroom
Like she know me well I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days they get so high
Burn trees smoke chlorophyll 'til they can't feel shit
Elevated train and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill miseducated my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy they said I should have never made it
Probably should have been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad enough of that jazz
Asshole absinthe up in that glass
Are we there yet Ice cubes in a bong
Rip brain dead take a tug and then pass

I could make a flow pitter patter with a patter pitter juicy
Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
That's the new principle sometimes I'mma be about some hoes
Sometimes I'mma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast I'm the Higgs Boson
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope see
Never scared of mean spirits methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm offa codeine low key
Don't be so judgmental even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
I'ma end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug and I can't 'cause I'm stanking

Young Rascal Flatts young ass kid ass could rap
Fuck all the faculty tobacco-packing acrobat
Back-to-back packin' bags back and forth with fifths of Jack and
Fourths of weed I'm back to pack on hands
With young Cletus to pat my back
Real nigga with a nose ring that's right
Just here to rap them songs
Rag on my hair wrap weed in Vegas rockin' Vagabonds
Sang a song oh you don't know What 
Well I still bang with you
Hang with you sip drank with you
As long as I can sang with you like

Niggas please be focused that Bino you know this
He rep the home of Sosas you know I'm from that Zone 6
You know I rep that Stone shit you know your hood is so clit
As God as my witness this Will Smith spit real shit
I'm going to be that CG busy gettin' where the weed at 
Bought your girl some new kneepads
You're fuckin' with the Fifi bag
My stars egad she said this my favorite song
Now she on the floor droppin' like it's hot
You blast this shit in Abercrombie when your work is finished
Your mom won't play it in the car 'cause it's got cursing in it
Two-step white dude's Harlem Shake
Why you laughing 
'Cause you Harlem Shake
I was never fake I was just too good to be true
That's acid rap we killed the track
You had your chance and 'Bino too

Foolies glad I'm home
Even my haters kinda glad I'm on
Rest In Peace to my Vagabond
Rapper song singer suspended subpoena
For misdemeanors dreamer
Held back ass is lowkey still a senior
And I still shake up BO Squad praying for my BroBois
City on the come up shout that nigga Sosa 
Shout my nigga Fat Trel shout my nigga Joseph
Playing Buenos Aires while they sleepin' buenas noches 
Wonder if I wrote this 'cause it's so crisp
The most brokest cold stock broker winter solstice
I could win an Oscar Russian accent husky
Acid addict costly avid actor Kevin Costner

God give me one sentence more
Maybe I just gotta get suspended more 
Hashtag it get mentions for it
Make you love it get it trending more
And then act humble
Hear some bull that some dude mumble
Wantin' to jump dude but let that nigga punk you
Knowin' bitch niggas wanna bring guns to the rumbles IGH 
But I love y'all souls don't let the juice spill Pac 
Blue pill pop 'til you feel good enough to pop
The popped bitch in the blue heels yop 
That one drown in the juice nigga
Hunnid proof get found in a youth nigga
Stop with all the tryna' introduce nigga
Everybody know you dude you the new nigga 
I ain't really been myself since Rod passed
I ain't even really need that shop class
I ain't really been weak since pop's smashed
I'm a genius a mothafuckin pop smash
Hit sensei master
Jack and Lindsey Wiley Kembe

Jugo you never tasted paper
Tripped racing yaself tryna' chase the paper
I just faced a Veggie
And you love being Kobe when you make the layer
'Til you realize everybody in the world fuckin' hates the Lakers
And then everybody wanna sip
'Til the juice spill everybody wanna bib
And then everybody wanna dip
Told you I ain't worried I ain't scared of the booth
All you can do is spit a verse of the truth
Merge the mixture with the purest and the fruits
And the thirst just the worst it's the curse of the juice 

And all I got to show for it is shoes and shows and chauffeurs with road rage
Still the same damn ad-lib IGH old ways
Still got a letterman no practice
Still got a burner man no lacking
Still outtin' Jams nigga no Jackson
No Jordan and we toe-tagging
I'll take you to land where the lake made of sand
And the milk don't pour and the honey don't dance
And the money ain't yours
Now it's just a red pill
Got a blue and a hand full of Advils
I'm the new Nitty fuck it Nitty the old me
So I'mma tell the buyer what Nitty told me

You a lame and your bitch break down my weed sometimes
See my face in the streets in the tweets
And a Reader or a RedEye if you read Sun-Times
She got blisters on her knees she's a fiend for the D
Even though I only beat one time
One time it was one two times
It was two plus me equals threesome time
Shouts out to Nate I jackball and I bop I flex
Got neck from all these thots I sex
Rastafari them shottas yes
House safari mi casa yes
Poppy fields of that popeye
She came to party she popped a Molly
Said Come to papa she said yes Papa yes

I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin' so my 9 with the shits

Move to the neighborhood I bet they don't stay for good watch
Somebody'll steal daddy's Rollie call it the neighborhood watch
Pray for a safer hood when my paper good watch
Still getting ID'd for Swishers
Still with the Save Money militia 
Trapped in the middle of the map with a little-bitty rock and a little bit of rap
That with a literary knack and a little shitty Mac and like literally jack

They murking kids they murder kids here
Why you think they don't talk about it They deserted us here
Where the fuck is Matt Lauer at Somebody get Katie Couric in here
Probably scared of all the refugees look like we had a fuckin' hurricane here
They'll be shooting whether it's dark or not I mean the days is pretty dark a lot
Down here it's easier to find a gun than it is to find a fucking parking spot
No love for the opposition specifically a cop position
'Cause they've never been in our position
Getting violations for the nation correlating you dry snitchin'

It just got warm out this the shit I've been warned 'bout
I hope that it storm in the mornin' I hope that it's pourin' out
I hate crowded beaches I hate the sound of fireworks
And I ponder what's worse between knowing it's over and dyin' first
'Cause everybody dies in the summer
Wanna say your goodbyes tell them while it's spring
I heard everybody's dying in the summer
So pray to God for a little more spring

I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
If you was there
Then we'd just knew you cared too
We don't do the same drugs no more 'cause she don't do the same drugs no more

When did you change 
Wendy you've aged
I thought you'd never grow up
I thought you'd never
Window closed Wendy got old
I was too late I was too late
A shadow of what I once was

Where did you go 
Why would you stay 
You must have lost your marbles
You always were so forgetful
In a hurry don't wait up
I was too late I was too late
A shadow of what I once was
'Cause we don't we don't do what we say we're gonna
You were always perfect and I was only practice
Don't you miss the days stranger 
Don't you miss the days 
Don't you miss the danger 

Don't forget the happy thoughts
All you need is happy thoughts
The past tense past bed time
Way back then when everything we read was real
And everything we said rhymed
Wide eyed kids being kids
Why did you stop 
What did you do to your hair 
Where did you go to end up right back here 
When did you start to forget how to fly 
It's so natural Just like Juicy Fruit
Works like a magic trick

I'm gon' praise Him praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up the blessings come down
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap

I don't make songs for free I make 'em for freedom
Don't believe in kings believe in the Kingdom
Chisel me into stone prayer whistle me into song air
Dying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair
Jesus' black life ain't matter I know I talked to his daddy
Said you the man of the house now look out for your family
He has ordered my steps  gave me a sword with a crest
And gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath

They booked the nicest hotels on the fifty-nineth floor
With the big wide windows with the suicide doors
Ain't no blood on my money ain't no Twitter in Heaven
I know them drugs isn't close ain't no visitin' Heaven
I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions
Like my ex girl getting pregnant
And her becoming my everything
I'm at war with my wrongs I'm writing four different songs
I never forged it or forfeited I'm a force to be reconciled
They want four minute songs
You need a four hour praise dance performed every morn
I'm feeling shortness of breath so Nico grab you a horn
Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water ugh 

Damn I'm in so deep girl
Probably 'cause you're empty
You can't even speak 
Damn your mouth so minty
Ooh your mama hate me
Daddy wouldn't let you if he ever met me
If he ever met you
Put that shit behind us
And put this in your sinus
Mine is all up in my gums
Minus all that shit it's lined with
You been scratchin' you been fiendin'
I'mma fix you I'mma fuck you
I'mma get rid of them demons

I blessed myself inside your arms one day
Swear to God there I was when the dress
And the silver buttons fade away
Miss Mary Mattress geriatrics
Fuck me into open caskets I wanna die with this
I wanna stop seeing my psychiatrist
The empty bottled loneliness this happiness you seek
The masochism that you preach
Practice back flips tragic actress
On a movie with no screen
When the only time he loves me is naked in my dreams

Kicked off my shoes tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah I inhaled who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young just turned older than him
I seen it happen I seen it happen I see it always
He still be screaming I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry I'm just not that thirsty
As of late all my verses seem not so versey
And all my words just mean controversy
Stressin' pullin' my hair out hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich
'Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls is that appealing to you 
From your cubicle desktop what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still thinks I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face

I am a new man I am sanctified
Oh I am holy I have been baptized
I have been born again I am the White Light
Rain don't go away

I got my city doing front flips
When every father mayor rapper jump ship
I guess that's why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets so my daughter can have somewhere to play
I'm the blueprint to a real man
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man
I ain't goin' to hell or to Hillman
I got caught up with a little Xan
Can't stop me but it slow me though
Yeah a nigga famous you don't know me though
But every DJ still play me though
Damn man I don't even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
'Til they fuck around and sign me to OVO
I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split an atom with me
I even had Steve giving out apples for free

I ain't change my number since the seventh grade
This for my day one ten years seven days
A week niggas never tired on they Kevin Gates
And if they rest in peace they bunny hopping heaven's gates
It's too many young angels on the southside
Got us scared to let our grandmommas outside
You gon' make me take the campers way downtown
You gon' make me turn my BM to my housewife
I just had a growth spurt
It done took so long my tippy toes hurt
You can keep the nose ring I don't have to soul search
I'm still at my old church only ever sold merch
Grandma say I'm Kosher momma say I'm culture

I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded
City so damn great I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat that's like the latest fashion

We used to roll at the Rink we used to roll at the Rink
I used to talk way too much you used to know everything
You couldn't stand me I couldn't stand you
You said I'm steady playin' but you steady playin' too
Your big brother foot work your play sister Juke
The Rink was the place but in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me too worried 'bout Frooties and Chews
'Til I found out all the shawdy's with cooties was cute and realized what booties could do

We never rolled at the Rink we would just go to the Rink
You ain't buy tokens no more you just hip roll at the Rink
You had a nigga I couldn't stand him
I mean it's just dancing it's harmless as fuck
Then I put my waist through your hips and your legs in my arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor all the kiddies stop skating
To see grown folks do what grown folks do when they grown and they dating

We gon' get it poppin' we gon' get it jukin'
We gon' throw a party and we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend came up for the weekend
Rollin' with the parties so tell me what you thinkin'
So we gon' have a juke jam we gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party just listening to music
Like we used to do I'll get close to you
I remember you you used to I remember you 'cause

Who smokin' in my car it's that nigga Chano
I just got back with 'Bino I got a bitch but she know
Her friends done did the Dino that's that Chicago lingo
Flamin' hots with cheese and a Kiwi Mistic
My dick won't even call her 'cause she left all that lipstick
Niggas be on dirt that's why I stay on petty
I know that bangers jam that's why my hands stay ready
Flip the candy yum that's the fucking bombest
Lean all on the square that's a fuckin' rhombus

I don't even talk to them on the phone again

Who's sneaking in the club that's that young sir rapper
Smoke all out the window cops could eat a dick
If you ain't the hitter you just might be the lick
Flame on flame on I'm your bitch's ringtone
She like when I rap raps but better when I sing songs
No Drake but I get my Trey on killin' in the hood like Trayvon
Shoppin' like I got a coupon savin' like I got a cape on
Cookin' crack in my apron dressed like a nigga had 8 proms
Tell shorty I may change and I made it and I napalm
Trippy shit to watch drugs while on the clock
Acid on the face that's a work of art

Throw it back like you tryna hurt somethin'
I'm so def I ain't ever heard nothin'
My name Herb take herb smoke herb 
How 'bout you No dap but I'll take a pound or two
No doubt like Gwen Stefani's group
Look let me put my mouth where you potty boo 
Them niggas pissed need potty training
They movement shit that's a potty train
She ain't left yet but she probably came
We kicked it then I score soccer game
She was a phony goalie I got great aim though don't insult me
I'll give it to ya straight this is what she told me
My name Soulo 'cause I'm the one and only
She only got you as a nigga on the side
That's a nigga on the side of a side bitch homie
Then we got out a Dodge like them Dukes of Hazzard
Music and tabs of Lucy take your chance with this rapper

Hey this ain't no intro this the entree
Hit that intro with Kanye and sound like Andre
Tryna turn my baby mama to my fiancee
She like music she from Houston like Auntie Yonce
Man my daughter couldn't have a better mother
If she ever find another he better love her
Man I swear my life is perfect I could merch it
If I die I'll prolly cry at my own service igh-igh 
It was a dream you could not mess with the Beam
This is like this many rings
Y'all know wha' mean 
This for the kids of the king of all kings
This is the holiest thing
This is the beat that played under the Word
This is the sheep that ain't like what it heard

I get my word from the sermon
I do not talk to the serpent
That's the holistic discernment
Daddy said I'm so determined
Told me these goofies can't hurt me
I just might make me some earl tea
I was baptized like real early
I might give satan a swirlie
Wish I could tell you it's ready
Tell you it's ready today
They don't give nothin' away
You gotta fight for your way
And that don't take nothin' away
'Cause at the end of the day

Music is all we got
Come on big fella you drunk big fella
Two sips and now you wanna trip big fella
You not a drinker I can see it all in your leg big fella
You wobbly big fella you finna fall
Sit down you drunk big fella

All night I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night I been drinking
All night I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night I been drinking hey
All night I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night I been drinking

Everybody outside everybody outside
When I pull up outside all night no
Everybody high five everybody wanna smile
Everybody wanna lie that's nice no
Oh now you wanna chill oh now you wanna build
Oh now you got the bill that's cool though
Oh now you got the gas oh now you wanna laugh
Oh now you need a cab that's true though
All you do is talk I ain't got shit to say
Can't no one get in my car I don't even valet
Long discussions oh you my cousin 
No you wasn't you just wanna ride
You just wanna talk about politics Chicago shit and rocket ships
 
Shut up Start dancing ho
All night I been drinking all night

You just went and spilt fries in the seat
It's fried on the seat come ride on the seat ay
Last girl she'll lie on the seat she'll fart on the seat
Now she jog in the streets say
I don't trust no one faking like a fan asking for a pic
You should use your phone call a Uber
You a goofy if you think I don't know you need a Lyft
Is you is or is you ain't got gas money
So back up back up I need space
Now I need you to slow down it's not a race
Now I can't really hear what you gotta say now
Shut up Start dancing ho

All night I been drinking all night
Ladies loving my music is like some sex shit
Niggas trying to grip up my mic like it's a dick 
Run around the corner to pick up the new shit 
Toss this in the deck so niggas can catch rep

What's good is good And what's good is evil
And what's good gangstas And what's good people 
And why's God's phone die every time that I call on Him 
If his son had a Twitter wonder if I would follow Him
Swallow them synonyms like cinnamon Cinnabon
Keep all them sentiments down to a minimum
Studious Gluteus Maxim models is sending him
Pics of they genitalia tallied up ten of 'em
I slurped too many pain-kills down I'm off a lot
I got a lot off days but it ain't often that I'm off the clock
Ya kna wha mean I got the Chicago Blues
We invented rock before the Stones got through
We just aiming back 'cause the cops shot you
Ain't no knuckling up 'em young 'cause it just not cool

Nice to see you Father New Year
Middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shooting death with weighted dice
And hitting stains on birthday candles
'Cause they help me beat my demon's ass

Everybody's somebody's everything
I used to tell hoes I was dark light or off white
But I'd fight if a nigga said that I talk white
And both my parents was black
But they saw it fit that I talk right
With my drawers hid but
My hard head stayed in the clouds like a lost kite
But gravity had me up in a submission hold
Like I'm dancing with the Devil with two left feet and I'm pigeon toed
In two small point ballet shoes with a missing sole
And two missing toes
But it's love like Cupid kissing a mistletoe

Nice to see you Father New Year
Middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shooting death with weighted dice
And hitting stains on birthday candles

Like Cassius ducking the draft and now the fight is over
The type to love from a distance not the type that told her
Spent three days on the rap trash it and type it over
With babies on the block under arms like fighting odors
Coppers and quotas
Hold ya head like 2Pac had taught
Obviously they are on a come up
With better chances tobogganing in the fucking summer
Concoctions for the bad days and a condom for the good ones
All odds against us we tryna get lucky
Doper than Lucky
You're ending happy that's only a tugging
Like Satan masturbating shit come hot
But y'all still love me ugh
How father time a deadbeat
Maybe I'm adopted
That'll explain why all of my shit been so timeless IGH

Even better than I was the last time baby
Even better than I was the last time

Rap just make me anxious and acid made me crazy
Them squares just made me looser and that wax just made me lazy
And I still make this song and I'ma make another
If you ever actually hit me better watch out for my brother
Better bet I'd take that deal gotta watch out for my mother
Get a watch with all that glitters come in clutters different colors
Did a ton of drugs and did better than all my Alma mater
Motherfucker money dance hundreds zan gallon lean
Make a joke 'bout Leno's hair then piggy back on Fallon's spleen
Balancing on sporadicity and fucking pure joy
Nightly searches for a bed and I just came off tour with Troy
But I can't complain I got some motherfucking bitches
How many lab partners have I fucked since I got suspended 
Mr. Bennett you done did it you did it you did it
You did a good ass job you did a good ass job

Flip a bird pigeon plane it's a word it's a shame
But God I'm good swear I couldn't be better
Kicking dirt on the shirts of the lames
Keep my work out in Texas that's just me flexing my lungs
See them showing they teeth that's just them flapping they gums
If they bite and I'm snapping clap clap collapsing they lungs
Call me Chancelor The Rapper
Magical word  please say 'Kadabra
Replay the replays Green Bay the Packers
Cremate your teammates and freebase the ashes
Matches to gas leaks dusted dusk 'til dawn
It's just us and trust ya bottom bitch my stuff the fucking bomb
I'm the motherfucking fucker fuck a niggas fucking dumb
This your favorite fucking album I ain't even fucking done

Socks on concrete Jolly Rancher kids
I was talkin' back and now I gotta stay at grandma's crib
Bunch of tank-top nappy headed bike-stealin' Chatham boys
None of my niggas ain't had no dad
None of my niggas ain't have no choice
JJ Mikey Lil Derek and them
Seventy-nineth street was America then
Ice cream truck and the beauty supply
Blockbuster movies and Harold's again
We were still catchin' lightnin' bugs
When the plague hit the backyard
Had to come in at dark 'cause the big shortys act hard
Okay now day camp at Grand Crossing
First day nigga's shootin'
Summer school get to losin' students
But the CPD getting new recruitment
Our summer don't get no shine no more
Our summer die our summertime don't got no time no more

Oh I used to kill 'em with the long hair
Mama hair salon doin' perms out the armchair
Dad was workin' late he treat the crib like it's a timeshare
I would mow some lawns
Fold my ones like a lawn chair
Now I'm the same way overtime all the time every night hey
Ready my blessin' now I'm ready how I wait
Never let a friendship get in my way
Never let a blog get in my way
Make the whole song do whatever I say
Some of my homegirls got lost in the paperwork
They was good friends but I faked the flirt
'Cause if it ain't work can't make it work
It's been a minute since I called on a friend
Fucked up and fucked all my friends

'Cause you're my friend
All my friends
You're my friend

May the Lord give your journey mercy
May you be successful grant you favor
And bring you back safely I love you

When I was so young before I could remember
I would always treat my gang like family members
Even when I changed a nigga never changed up
I always bring my friends my friends my friends my friends up
When I was so young before I could remember
I would always treat my gang like family members
Even when I changed a nigga never changed up
I always bring my friends my friends my friends my friends up
If this is my last shit my last shit
Uhh it definitely be mad important
Ey man that sound like a Prince song

Somebody pray for the god oh lord
I wonder what Michael's on
Son jammin' to his shit
Rappin' trappin' trippin' 'cid
And sniffing glue and chewing Vicodin
Shoulda died yelling YOLO was a lie
And you a liar wonder why you wanna die so young
You and I look just alike
And I'm afraid that this one right here
Might be last time that I write a song
Lot of niggas wanna go out with a bang
But I ain't tryna go out at all
So I ain't tryna go out at all
Got a lot of ideas still to throw out the door
Last Chance joint gotta be a dance joint
From an introspective drugged out standpoint
Throw bands joint wanna hold hands joint
Old school for my own old man joint

This part right here right now
Right here this part my shit
I play this so loud in the car
I forget to park my whip
I lean back then spark my shit
I turn up I talk my shit
Hope you love all of my shit
I hope you love all of my shit 

Why toss my filter when she saving my life 
The same shit that kills us always feels so right
That's why I pray to the dealer
God know who he be
Truth be told he juiced me
Introduced me to the lucy leaf
I seen the light I lost my lighter
Bic flick kick the habit and the bucket fuck your supplier
Lies Levis on fire
Flyer on the wall I'm brighter
In the darkness of the night

This part right here right now
Right here this part my shit
I play this so loud in the car
I forget to park my whip
I lean back then spark my shit
I turn up I talk my shit
Hope you love all of my shit
I hope you love all of my shit 

I'm still a chain smoking
Name dropping
Good looking
Muh' fucking
Motha shut your mouth
Brain broken
Frank Ocean listening
Stain hitting satin woodgrain gripping
Paint dripping
Motha shut your mouth
I speak of promised lands
Soil as soft as momma's hands
Running water standing still
Endless fields of daffodils and chamomile
Rice under black beans
Walked into Apple with cracked screens
And told prophetic stories of freedom
Found warmth in a Black queen for when I get cold
Like Nat King I'm doing the dad thing
I speak of wondrous unfamiliar lessons from childhood
Make you remember how to smile good
I'm pre-currency post-language anti-label
Pro-famous I'm Broadway Joe Namath
Kanye's best prodigy
He ain't signed me but he proud of me
I got some ideas that you gotta see
Make a vid with shawty and they ship it like the Odyssey
They never seen a rapper practice modesty
I never practice I only perform
I don't even warn I don't eat it warm I won't be reborn
I speak to God in public I speak to God in public
He keep my rhymes in couplets
He think the new shit jam I think we mutual fans
I used to dance to Michael I used to dance in high school
I used to pass out music I still pass out music
The people's champ must be everything the people can't be
I'm getting artsy-fartsy house full of some Hebru Brantleys
You must've missed the come up I must be all I can be
Call me Mister Mufasa I had to master stampedes

I made it through made it through made it through
And everything I gave to you I gave to you I gave to you
You got it you got it you got it it's coming 
So are you ready 

And we back and we back and we back

They ain't teaching taxes in school
It don't even matter I was acting a fool
But who would think the raps would turn into racks 
Scars on my head I'm the boy who lived
The boy love playing when the boy too sick
Reclining on a prayer I'm declining to help
I've been lying to my body can't rely on myself oh no
Last year got addicted to Xans
Started forgetting my name and started missing my chance
L.A. for four months end up leaving right back
I'm in love with my city bitch I sleep in my hat
I felt hogtied ever since my dog died
He lived to eighty-four damn that's a long ride
I know he up there he just sit and he wait
I'll be racing up the stairs I'mma get to the gate singing

Hey Gimme the water gimme the water I need the kind from Space Jam
Get this money get this budget to day camp
Me and my girl plan to stay to the end
Hope there never come a day where we be better as friends
We in a marathon we could build a marriage on
Arguments as parents digging deeper than a baritone
I've been getting blocked just trying to make songs with friends
Labels told me to my face that they own my friends
I got the power I could poke Lucifer with crucifix
I cannot scrap the stupid shit I stand up like I'm Ludacris
I know some folks that talk so much you'd think they drive an Uber whip

Lord rain down on me so I can move on water
Like children at the altar like God inside my house
You made a church out of feathers so when she fly to the Father
She know the choir gon' follow and all the offering paid
She gave my name away to your holy house
She like my blessings in disguise she likes her Jesus mountain high
So He can watch her lonely child I know my God
I know my God seen His breaks and His edges
Are jagged for giving that pain to His city in gold
Like everything is everything
Like all them days He prayed with me
Like emptiness was tamed in me
And all that was left was His love

God is better than the world's best thing
God is better than the best thing that the world has to offer

Magnify  lift it on high
Spit a Spotify to qualify a spot on His side
I cannot modify or ratify my momma made me apple pies
Lullabies and alibis the book don't end with Malachi
Devil will win employee of the month by the dozen
'Til one score and three years from the third when he doesn't
My village raised 'em a child come through the crib and it's bustin'
You meet anyone from my city they gon' say that we cousins
Shabach barak edify
Electrify the enemy like Hedwig till he petrifies
I don't believe in science I believe in signs
Don't believe in signing I seen dollar signs color white collar crime
Good God the gift of freedom Hosanna Santa invoked
And woke up slaves from Southampton to Chatham Manor
My dream girl's behind me feel like I'm James Early
The type of worship make Jesus come back a day early
With the faith of a pumpkin-seed-sized mustard seed
Hear for I will speak noble things as entrusted me
Only righteous I might just shrug at the skullduggery
I couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody
Exalt glorify descend upon the earth with swords
And fortify the borders where your shortage lie
I used to hide from God ducked down in the slums like Snake

I was lost in the jungle like Simba after the death of Mufasa
No hog no meerkat
Hakuna matata by day
But I spent my night time fighting tears back
I prayed and prayed and left messages
But never got no hear back or so it seemed
A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream
I build the ark to gently
Row my boat down Noah's stream
Sometimes the path I took to reach
My petty goals was so extreme
I was so far down in the mud
Couldn't even let my light shine
But you was always there
When I needed to phone a friend or use a life line
From a lofty height we wage war
On the poltergeist with the exalted Christ
Spark the dark with the pulse of light
Strike a corpse with a pulse of life
I spit on the Tidal it's tidal waves
I spit on the Apple and kill a worm
A fire in Califronia will swallow a valley
For every African village burned
Jay Elect would've never made it
Oh son of man
Who was the angel in Revelations
With a foot on water and a foot on land 
Who was the angel that rode a Harley
From the project to the house of Parliament
And opened the book in the Devil's chamber
And put the true name of the Lord in it 
Old Jerusalem New Jerusalem
Comes like this beast with a ball of fire
They poisoned the scriptures
And gave us the pictures of false messiahs it was all a lie
Mystery babylon tumbling down
Satan's establishment crumbling down
This is the year that I come for the crown
Bury my enemies under the ground
We just been smoking a bowl
What the fuck is going on 
When did we buy a bowl 

We just been smoking a bowl
We don't got no time to roll
I'm always out on the road
She don't got time for a whole
Little bit of time that we have
We used to purchase a half
It don't be no time to smoke
I'm always throwing on clothes
She always throwing a fit
We don't got no time for no sex
I just put milk in the bowl
She don't be cooking at all
She just put weed in the bowl
She don't have time for herself
She putting points on the board yes
You know she carry her own
You know she carry a child
She wake up at crack of dawn
She don't be cracking a smile
So when she packing the bowl
I grab her I tell her

Truth being told we used to movies and bowl
We used to Netflix and roll
I used to pass her the smoke
She used to laugh at my jokes
You pat my back when I choke
Wish we were stuck in our ways
We way too young to get old
We stuck together like oowops
We smoke to Fetty sing ZooWap
Traphouse 3 Guwop
I should have knew when I grew up
It would be no time at all
We went from White Owls to Raws
We went from joints to a bowl
She need a second to breathe
We need an actual smoke sesh

I don't have time to finesse
I put some ice on your neck
But I ain't holding you back
I spend my time on the road
Super ain't saving no hoes
I don't have time to patrol
Let me break these bales right down for a second
When it touch down ooh
I got to lay back the roof
I got her breakin' the new rules
She can't be taking no calls
When she involved with a boss
Please don't get lost in the sauce
She been like this from the door
Told me her mom was a whore
I gave her percs for myself
I give her a perc for esteem
I'm tryna crown me a queen
You hear the chains when they cling
I take the molly its clean
I push the whip with the wings
I gotta be overseas
I gotta be on the pedal
I push it down to the floor
I got designer galore
I keep some Goyard and gars
I smoke out all of my cars
You smell the weed in the air
You smell the smoke in the seats
You went and had our child
You didn't abandon the D
You got me twisted at least

Introducin' Chance the Ruthless trip 'shrooms and lucy
Dreams is lucid loosely based on music swallow my mucus
Hope your pussy get herpes and yo' ass get lupus
Shoes might boot cha and a suit might suit cha
They be on bullshit but they really don't do shit
They use of allusion could confuse Confucius
Nasty ashy cigarette ashing 'til my voice get raspy
Last week suspended last night kissed Va$htie
Parleyed with Ashley always in the hallway
So I never been classy 

Acid melts through plastic I spit fired
Pad my palette talkin' paper if this was work I'd get higher
Pardon my mishaps burp and get murdered
Fart and get bitch-slapped like bourbon mixed with Jack
Lickety-split look it He slipped on a shell
From peelin' banana splits back give me my Kit-Kat
Don't break me off shit batch fack is you mean bitch 
Zan with that lean bitch zan with that lean bitch
Zen with that chakra I eat it like Idi Amin
Ya kna wha' mean hit me back when that mean shit

With my hair slicked back I look like Rick Pitino
Three Japanese dykes in my El Camino
Lettin' trees blow oh I rep the East Coast
I got a team of hoes like Pat Summitt
I look like Arnold Schwarzenegger in a black hummer
 
I splash summer like a fast brother with a number on his back
Ain't no fumblin' in fact I'm back acid in my hat
Shoot then pass the gat
It's at the bottom of the river in a plastic bag 
My new shorty got a gymnastic back
She had the cleft palate I ordered chef's salad
She had the club foot with that little arm
I couldn't help but laugh she ordered Chicken Parm
I had the full Bulls warm-up with the Pippens on

Suck my motherfucking dick
It's the young Randy Velarde
Queens baby blow me
Chance the motherfuckin' Rapper
Am I the only nigga still care about mixtapes 
I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
 
I swear I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how the lips taste

All I can hear is the third ayy
We don't know none of your words ayy
I love my women real tall ayy
Type that can really play ball ayy
You buy my hat at the park ayy
Think I might really play ball ayy
I got a link in my bio
My bitch do the salsa like pico de gallo
They gotta ask if they may Cinco de Mayo
How can they call themselves bosses
When they got so many bosses
You gotta see what your boss say
I get it straight out the faucet
I ain't felt like this since the third Drought third Carter drop
Told my momma third grade I'd be in the third Barbershop
And yeah my momma got real worried when she heard college drop
But now I call the shots

I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
I swear I'm the only nigga still cares about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste

Bad little mama she gettin' it Obama
She sting like a bumble bee hot as the sauna
She shine like a Rollie got that from her momma
Can't see me can't be me I'm ridin' like a panda
That booty gon' roll and it's outta control
And these bitches gon' fuck off respect and that loyalty
All my bitches lovin' me and they spoil me
Rub me down with that lotion babe oil me
Drinking Actavis baby I'm showin' me
In that choppa I see your perimeter
Change the culture 'cause my ring is a solar
Wait one minute I told you
Yeah I would like to know you
Yeah you lucky like clovers
Yeah the clothes no good
Mama I do it
The racks I pursue it
Just look at me baby
I came from the sewers
They love all the slime ball
Like they fuck all these cats on your slime dog
I got me some rings like I'm Bruce Bowen
I'm ballin' on you like I'm Chris Paul

I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste
I swear I'm the only nigga still care about mixtapes
Bad little bitch wanna know how lips taste

Am I the only one who really care about cover art 
Growing up I ain't have my brother
'Cause he said the streets gave him a fresh start
I ain't know what that mean
I bumped heads with my dean
Dropped out and hit the scene
Now I'm stunting like bling
Time and time again they told me no
They told me I wouldn't go
'Cause in high school all I cared about was hoes
Well maybe that shit was my interest
Now I spend more than they make at my dentist
After one night the folks thought I was finished
I pinned my name to the game like a seamstress
Oh bitch I bite like a gator
Fuck them reviews that they put in the paper
Did what I wanted didn't care about a hater
Delivered my tape to the world as a caterer
Oh they fuck with me 'cause I'm different
New sound new appearance
Bitch it's Boat from the 6
Give a fuck about a bitch
Walk out my hand on my dick I'm the shit

'Member sittin' in class the first time listening to Dilla
Everything's good
Rubbin' on yo chin sippin gin Margiela brand chinchilla
Everything's good
My manager backpack packed with packs of cigarillos
And some fruit snacks and some killers
Phone numbers on speed dial call them save monkey guerillas
Everything's good
I ain't really that good at goodbyes
I ain't really that bad at leaving
I ain't really always been a good guy I used to be thirsty thievin'
Runnin through purses even persons leave 'em hurtin' bleedin
I ain't really help the helpless
I used to be worse than worthless
Now I'm worth hooks and verses
I'm good like books in churches
Harolds and Hooks and Churches
Everything's Good
See my name when you Google search it
Use a card when I make a purchase
Everything's Good
But I knew I was fly when I was just a caterpillar
That I'd make it even if I never make a milla
When I meet my maker he gon' make sure that we chillin'
And everything's good
I ain't really that good at goodnight I ain't really that bad at sleepin'
With bad bitches put them aside I used to be thirsty creeping
Now I'm out working evenings birthdays even Tuesdays
Wednesdays Thursdays weekends rehearsing verses murdering merch and events
Damn it feel good to be a gangsta
And it feel good for me to thank you
Put money back in your bank account
Off of songs I barely could think up
'Cause a lot of songs niggas gon' make up
Make sense but they never gon' make a sound
And I'm better than I was the last time crescendo
Thanks Justin lending them pencils
Mr. Menzies Mensa Chris Minto
The time I beat Chris on Nintendo
Remember jacket shoppin' after listening to Thriller
Remember the first time you heard this through
Everything's good
Here's a tab of acid for your ear
You're the plastic I'm the passion and the magic in the air
The flabbergasted avalanche of ambulances near
The labyrinth of Pan's Lab is adamantly here
No assignments book of rhyming and I'm drawing doodles
I should rhyme with Ramen Noodles
Ramadan I'm the don of the diamond jewels
Fond of finding a way to kindly tell these toddlers toodles
I'm a kamikaze and I'm a kinda cuckoo
I could write a fucking book non kamasutral
You niggas goofies it's a conflict that is kinda crucial
Caught you on the 9 in all blue yelling I'm a neutral
But I'ma let the bull pass like matadors
Versus a Minotaur verse is a metaphor
Metamorphoses and I'ma fuckin animorph
Remember I used to bang with the bad ones
'Til my grandmama told on her grandson
Mama said that I was way too handsome
To be throwing the hand's son breaking walls like Samson
But I'ma throw a tantrum 'til I'm on every Samsung
Sanyo and handheld and handgun
Please put ya lighter's up 'til life is up and light it up
And slice a cut the night is young it's nice enough
The nicest blunt the nicest stuff
My niggas out here trapping a lot
I know you think you on hiding Reggie sacks in your socks
I hang with niggas whole jab in the jock
Only the goofies though choking on a doobie though
My eyes do be low two be rolled remember days of the Rufio
Remember the Days of Chan-Man and the Skeeter Man
Brrang dang to Lil' B and bang a-rang to Peter Pan

I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried bout my brain cells 

Light a joint or spliff it if you classy
Split a swisha witcha nigga if you ask me
Ain't no questions hit it vividly and pass me
Don't answer about your problems
Or your issues or your Ashleys
It's a quarter to imminent ten minutes to infinite
Cinnamon tone women and feminine's getting intimate
All broads is frivolous homies could get they dividends
Is he illiterate literal syndicate
Illegitimate idiot gangbanger affiliate
Sick twisted prick sick sadistic
Son of a biscuit man fuck this shit
IGH I burned too many brain cells down
What's better than tripping is falling in love
What's better than Letterman Leno Fallon and all the above
What's better than popping bottles trying to ball in the club
Is the first caveman pops with his son ball and a club
What's better than paper is ballin' it up
What's better than followers is actually fallin' in love
What's better than frolicking follies fallin' in mud
Rolling in green pastures wanderin' followin' love
What's better than eating is feeding your fam
What's better than meetings is missing meetings to meet with your fam
What's better than leaning and needing a Xan
Is hitting your zan dreaming a dream could mean leaving the land
What's better than yelling is hollerin' love
What's better than rhymes nickels dimes and dollars and dubs
Is dialing up your darling just for callin' her up
It ain't nothing better than fallin' in love

That's love that's love that's love that's love
Charlie Bartlett John Bender
Class Switcher Time Bender
Chance Bennett a peculiar name
Graduation night teachers Ferris Bueller'd my name
You made a mixtape Good job I hope you get a good job
We was all outcasts only listened to Good Mob
I performed at fun fair fun fact
I'm never going back to school been there done that
They see my little ten Day tape and my dumb raps
Don't call it impossible if you really want that
They send my ass to summer school don't call it a comeback
I just came to beat a bully's ass and get my lunch back
Chano y tequila you know you know you don't want that
I rap my songs in Spanglish I wrap my weed in blunt wraps
Wrapped up in this one line I hope that shit get unwrapped
As if niggas was getting signed off of a line off one rap
Yo Vic remember when they called us some freshmen niggas rapping 
Now I ain't gonna be a freshman and I'm rapping
I should've learned a lesson from all of this shit happening
I just look over to Justin for refreshments of the Captain
It's sipping when it's weak sauce it's shots if it's cracking
Sip it when we tear up and chug it if we laughing
Fuck it if we're fucked up I never thought of Chatham
Until the day they said I would have to chat without em
And I'm just in the studio hoping that it sounds right
Here's a brighter bulb for your limelight
And this is your night homie shine bright
This for everybody's fucking prom night

Uh yo this prom shit feel like the Grammy's yo
These pictures Granny took gonna make me ask where'd Granny go
So pass the Sanyo to Auntie Jo
And snap a couple candid's of the family get some cameos
You can change the clocks but you can't change hours
I'm waiting on the day Spring can't bring flowers
Let me ask for minutes from dad for those campaign hours
And pour these thirsty hoes a couple champagne showers
And hop up in that limo the hood going dummy
The hood fucking love me the hood think we lovely
So go and pop some bubbly this right here's to loyalty
This to a moment's glimpse at royalty
This is for my momma Jan who spoiled me
Look what we've accomplished
Time flies watches look like magnets on a compass
Before we dip Gladys said a prayer over the limo
Bumping ten Day with the Angels with Jesus shopping my demo
And rode up out of Chatham the whole hood clapping
And damn it would be crazy if any of this shit had happened
But it didn't I missed prom I missed it to spin
I did a show at akin and I would do it again

Look at look at your business tux all night airplane
Go and get your racist on all white everything
I'm on my paper now put that on my heading
I ain't even write this down I don't write errthing
I know y'all don't like everything
She want a night she can call her wedding
Giving Eskimo kisses with some Eskimo bitches
Nose diving going all night sledding
'Cause honestly I've always loved the way that you could throw up
Rest up on my shoulder float up flying lotus
You deserve a warm towel you deserve a soda
You deserve a quiet room you deserve a sofa
You deserve a Ferrari and a matching tiara
And a hand to wipe away all that running mascara
But I want to thank you for this prom night
Thank you for this prom night
I really enjoyed my prom night

To be with you tonight
Turn the radio up and we can have a good time
Got me feeling like J.J. on Good Times
Back when Thelma had that ass off the fam good
My sister said she likes my raps 'cause it sounds good
Told me not to cut corners use to cut quarters
Sitting in the room on the phone cooking up orders
Till my pops popped me off that was family matters
Used to watch him in the kitchen sipping Sammy Adams
Now I'm rollin' iPhone Stolen
Mama whip with 5 of my guys 4 holdin'
Trying to live our lives like our lives are so golden
Got big shoes to fill like try go bowling
Til we strike out we just hoping we don't strike out
4th quarter how you gon go and take Mike out 
Summertime Chi I had to pull the bike out
Riding getting nice 'cause it's nice out

Let's land in the land where the Famo stay
Grind all day til the fam okay
It still warm my heart to hear my grandma pray
For the fam of my friends when my mans go away 

Don't wake up don't wake up don't wake up too fast
Don't make up your mind you should flake on that class
Sing all you want just don't Drake on they ass
Shore you got drive don't turn fake on they ass
Good morning good raps good morrow good luck
Tonight you could blow tomorrow you suck
Bizarro my carro I borrowed from Chuck
No money for the meter when I'm parkin' em
Gassed than a bitch no car with him
Market him tell him that he's buzzing like a game of operation with Parkinsons
Young kid rappers kidnappers
Young whipper snapper that will whip past ya
Will get at you come get at you
Wanna break ya off Come Kit-Kat you

Now the team work make the dream work
Go ahead and send an application if you need work
If it need hurt then I'mma bring hurt
How you finna see the clouds if you never seen dirt
Now you finna play it loud listen how it's goin down
Didn't know the name before bet you niggas know it now
Got some titties at the cribby and the Savemoney with me and we going in
Going all out for them hoes again
Now I'm fin to bring the fucking flow and bend it back
And show it's more to this than rap
Love my parents for supporting 'cause they know I'm finna crack
Know my niggas got my back got some niggas selling packs
But I'm tryin' to get em cheese so I can get em out the trap
Now my figures getting fat a lot of hoes be tryin' to jack
But I got her on my lap All she do is make it clap
I believe that if I fly prolly end up somewhere in paradise
I believe that if I fly I'll prolly end up somewhere in paradise

Chancelor the rapper Chatham the hood
Santa to children had to bag up the goods
They say I'm savin' my city say I'm stayin' for good
Told your ass since day one I don't like labels or titles
I'm a rascally rabbit I know that tricks is for addicts
That need fixes for habits in love with carrots and cabbage
I'm a savage established bad bitch magnet I'm magic
Your majesty I'm majestic I think my message is massive
Think you passive aggressive
I think you passed up your prime
Think you passed up your chance to be Chance
Now pass it to A-Rappers
I should have rhymed it with rhyme
Ain't we been here before 
Ain't my principal told me that I can't rap at that show 
Then I rapped at that show simple as that
Got a complex from Complex off of the simplest raps
And it goes like this

Fannin' the fire hands is up higher
Cannot believe it damn I'm a rider
Ridin' on twenties twenty years prior I couldn't buy a
Forget it you get it
God is so awesome devil's a liar
Take 'em to church but I need a choir

Blow out your speakers roll some more loud
That's the sound of the reefer I think my parents is proud
Thank my fans in the bleachers
Think my teachers need features
I think I'm walkin' with Jesus I knew my feet wouldn't drown
I been close to the edge I been trippin' and stuff
Somebody slipped me a mickey
But I ain't giving a fuck
Really a milli How 'bout six billion more
Or I'm outie like how'd he cut that umbilical cord 
As I smoke herb in this Uber suburban dressed in an Urban Outfitters
Shirt and burgundy pair of Jordans
I asked the acid if words were worth worryin' over
Her explanation seemed agitated
She said let me answer your question
With some questions questionin' yours
Like why the devil can't get you 
And why these labels can't catch you 
And why'd he make you so special why did he bless you 
Think about it
I woke up this mornin'
Gotta smile when I say that shit I woke up this mornin'

Fannin' the fire hands is up higher
Cannot believe it damn I'm a rider
Ridin' on twenties twenty years prior I couldn't buy a
Forget it you get it
God is so awesome devil's a liar
Take 'em to church but I need a choir

I believe I believe there's somewhere out there for us all there's a paradise 
I believe that if I die I'll see my homies somewhere in paradise

Fannin' the fire hands is up higher
Cannot believe it damn I'm a rider
Ridin' on twenties twenty years prior I couldn't buy a
Forget it you get it
God is so awesome devil's a liar
Take 'em to church but I need a choir

I still got orange and white cassette tapes
Tents where my neighbor came to spectate
Niggas that's tough now used to get little in the dark
It's all cool now we're all little kids at heart
Accident prone Chance y'all remember 'bout
The time I cracked my head open at Auntie Linda's House
From diapers to outfits to castles to Elmos
From Santas to Grandmas to Gameboys and cellphones
Rocked your world fourth grade talent show
Jada and Justin's birthday magic show
Games of tips taking niggas to school
Two quarters and I'll bust your ass at pool on bull
Round here we lose best friends like every week
I like to think we playin a long game of hide and go seek
And one day maybe I'ma find Terrance and I could lead them
Kids of the Kingdom singing about freedom

Heads down eyes shut time to play Seven Up
Heads bowed hands clutched bottles gone Heavens up
Smiles come through though my eyes might cry
When they reminisce over you my God

Let's take it back like Indian givers
To Indian burns and Jiminy Crickets
To the smell of Pillsbury on biscuit mornings
To puffy wintercoats and Christmas mornings
I used to chill with the kids next door
And SpongeBob came around 'bout four
And then I'd hang with Bart's guys
Around the bend was Smart Guy
Flipping through the picture books
Checking through my archives
Remember the old days the ones you'll never get back
At the end of parties passing around gift bags
Now we blow entire O's at one kick back
Misfits and mismatch that get off like wrist slaps uhh

Heads down eyes shut time to play Seven Up
Heads bowed hands clutched bottles gone Heavens up
Smiles come through though my eyes might cry
When they reminisce over you my God

Remember Jeepers and Odyssey Fun World
Young pimpin' like you oughta see one girl
Mama Jann mama Charlie and my mama Lisa
Booster seat used to boost my kitty Connie's Pizza
And every year we made a Christmas list
And Auntie Linda cooked a Christmas dish
And all of our grandparents made a Christmas wish

Heads down eyes shut time to play Seven Up
Heads bowed hands clutched bottles gone Heavens up
Smiles come through though my eyes might cry
When they reminisce over you my God

I said 'Hey Ma' don't go stretching your wallet
These niggas gotta pay me for taking a year from college
Go on get ya nails polished stylist for your eyelids
And a pilot for your mileage for them frequent flights to your island
Ms. Brown and Ms. Pollock little boy done grown up
Little voice done blown up middle-class that bonus
Hey Ma Hey Mama Jan God just gave me another chance
Rod just gave me another line probably gave me another fan
Since Kanye was a three-old
Down the street from D. Rose was practicing his free-throws
Shout out to that Gulf Shrimp shout out to King Gyro
Shout out that Ms. Moody auntie Toni them my heroes

You gon' see us laid up 
Monica and Ava thanks for all the favors

And haters gonna throw that epsom

I got suspended  you got suspended
Fans all in the stands they hands for Mr. Bennett
That racket over the net give me my tennis
Shoes give me a minute I can't be tardy
My class is already started they told my mom I'm retarded
But that ten Day done in one night Honda from a Hyundai
No tassel in the spring but after summer I'm alumni
They took my nigga one night and I was standing right there
An inch away from Heaven a million songs from right here
A step away from South by a swing away from Cali
A hook away from verses I'm a dad away from rapping
So at the school they arrested him
Back seat squad car nestled in
Shouts to the bitch nigga Heselton
Wit' his Big Show body ass wrestlin'
So far so good so special and
No stars good jobs or excellents
And I'm still so fucking non-echelon you got suspended  you not gon' finish
you look familiar  you look like Kenneth
Damn they gon' resent it  you representin'

I hate my bed I hate my home I hate my job
I hate the wife I hate the kids I hate the dog
I hate the sun I hate the rain I hate the clouds
I hate the TV hate the dinner hate the couch
I hate the car I hate the bus I hate the road
I hate the bar I hate to drink I hate to smoke
I hate a stranger hate his boss I hate his friend
I hate the womb I needed room I ate my twin
I hate my hands handshakes pancakes milkshakes
Child-resistant locks on the pill case
I hate inflation hate the store I hate to choose
I hate the war I hate the poor I hate the news
I hate the late I can't be early hate to wait
I hate my lovers 'cause the way they suffocate
I fuck to hurt it hurt to date I hate to date
I fuck to hate I hate to love I hate to hate

I hate to lose I hate to try I hate to win
I hate to cruise I hate to fly I hate to swim
I hate the optimistic smirks on the face of children
I hate the government and those who deface its buildings
I hate artists hate creatives I hate bright people
I hate darkness I hate racists I hate white people
I hate small speakers I hate loud speakers
I hate great concerts I don't like crowds neither
I hate money I hate change I hate hope
I hate funny I hate strange I hate dope
I hate charities and parodies and tragedies
I hate carrots peas asparagus
Virtually all vegetables circuses all festivals
Texts that are oversexual motion because it's perpetual
I hate schedules calendars reminders 'cause they just remind us That tomorrow gon' be just as timeless

No weapon formed against me shall prosper
My sword look just like Michael's
He lent it to me this a house of God
I'm just leasing he rent it to me
This sentence he penned it too
That's a Gmail he sent it to me
I can send you his contact hit him if you in combat
Hit him if you in traffic even if there ain't no static
That's my G he got me shinin'
My hair he made it tangled
My seed don't need no lining
A halo fits on an angel
And if the shoe fits I'll tie his and let the kiddie rap
Finally give the city back and ask God for a piggy-back
Up on his shoulders I notice I'm within earshot
Thanks for makin' us in your image
You got a good sense of hubris
Sparring is training
Chain snatching the slaves
But a rap song is a match in a cave
Dim lit wet wick wicked wrath in its way
Drunk off of light lies laughing
Claiming asylum while shying in shade
I can't stay silent I go violent when my violets is gray
And my roses is black
Fuck the pharaohs and pharisees Moses is back
I don't need to see a Sphinx to know they noses was black
I don't know one temptation that had Otis' back
Sparring is training this a jumping jack
I'm the scariest jack in the pumpkin patch
Float like my jumper wet sting like a bumblebee
I swing like a lumber jack go back when I'm up at bat
They tried to label me a non-rapper
I'm an independent contractor
Card cracker sparring is training without the training wheels
You made it you made it you made it yeah you made a deal
You played it straight hated graduated waited
You still a waiter still
Mice will always find out ways to steal
Picture me fifth of Hennessy and the swisher sweet
Fake identity 'til a plug named Trinity shook me
Said one plus one make three and you finna see
You ain't as grown as you finna be
You got them young nigga tendencies

I let the light in beside him I stand like angel
Sparring is training for an apathetic halo
Apologetic non religious consequential fable
Like good is good the love in me is goodly or godly
The Bible say mistakes is necessary
So I Mississippi monologue to granny house
My soloist is sold out to attentive God
Cornbread on my table when I say my prayers
On airs to stairs where shadiness is time to rest or manifest
Sparring is training I know they think me bumblebee
But bet I sting no die

Sparring is training

Jacob wrestled with God in the desert 'til he broke him
And he blessed him and he rescued his heart
I struggle with love I juggle my loves
I cuddle and coddle ship wreckin' bottle I huddle in hugs
Sparring is training bra Ramses watching raining frogs
A tandem unicycle with two pilots in different maps

You giving back Tit for tat

Synagogue and bottle caps
A body in the underpass says where's my Jesus 
Pledge allegiance to the money now
We runnin down to kiddie parks where darker kids be casualty
Like come with me to the museum

Excuse them they know of what they do

Sparring is training don't let Denzel Training Day you
Sensei could catch a fade too
We be onnat elegant hella melanin

And now you know Noname ain't never for none
 
Boom bap and you don't stop
I told you that was gonna be fun though
Fuck with me y'all
I mean either way you stuck with me y'all
I'm coming at these rap niggas first
And for most that's unluckily y'all
Better know it
Just a mustard seed dog that I ever really needed
Nigga's just tryna see Jesus
Sipping water like it come with different cheeses
All of your opinions facetious it's feces
I got a thesis or slick dissertation
Our entire species is young and impatient and passive
All at the same damn time why Chi to kill them with kindness
Hit them with the Visine try to cure the blindness
Couple coffee beans for the sinus
Folgers the best part of waking up
Is the alignment of self with God and that isn't for a selfish heart
My intention was to flood the scene
I don't ever really hug the scene
Y'all know I been submarine with this shit
Little more Actavis how I lean with this shit
Black as hell still the cream of this crop
With dream no king just Ving Rhames with six shots
It's the dawn of the dead and I feel so alive
And the free been in here you can tell by my mind like

You just a grown ass kid who the fuck do you think you is 
The sun is only half way risen you haven't come out your crib
You just a grown ass boy get up out of here with all that noise
You ain't ever gonna find no joy playin' yourself like a toy you just a
You just a grown ass kid who the fuck do you think you is 
The sun is only half way up you steady talking that shit
You just a grown ass boy get up out of here with all that noise
You ain't ever gonna find no joy playin' yourself like a toy you just a

Lazy male complaining about how in high school he could but his lazy
Ay be clear this my daddy house you just the uncle from Jay-Z
 
Boy get your biggrown ass on
Old ass home broke ass drinking up all the milk
But can't do no laundry 'cause romance is on the way
Watch your tone folk talking to grown folk
Yeah get that bass out your voice you were sounding like Tone Loc
Now watch how I move different chapters
Decisions missions visit pastors
Everybody finally can say it out loud
My favorite rapper a Christian rapper
And he got fate in his faith in his soul
And a tape and a cape and that drape from out west
To the lake and it cover his face like a Bape
And I hate when I wait but it never come late
From tobacco back roads to bus seat back rows
A Black boy black rose back rolls
Men grow just as surely as mountains peak and plateaus plateau ya kna wha' mean 

You just a grown ass kid who the fuck do you think you is 
The sun is only half way risen you haven't come out your crib
You just a grown ass boy get up out of here with all that noise
You ain't ever gonna find no joy playin' yourself like a toy

Kinda crazy how it fall up in your lap right 
Shit was determined in a past life
If you ask nicely mad nice
Even with mad lights you couldn't see the boy
Up in class like I'm only half right they ain't believe the boy
Wave when you pass them moments you should bask in
Wonder if the Lord's on my side let me ask him or ask her
I don't need a password don't ask about my past word
Living until my last words wondering if this music got the slash in
Don't forget the cash and mix in with the passion oh
If I don't feel the love then I'mma pass end
Shit is everlasting I'mma have a blast and uh
I'mma have a good day I'mma stay zonin'
I might get high as shit or I might stay sober
Might roll a J and I might just pass it
Might hit the Bay and I might trip acid
They tried to treat us like some bummy little sneakers
When you dream make sure that you dream big
You could be cool and an Uber driver
The next minute you in Aruba you scuba divin'
I hope they sell you the truth and that you survivin'
Don't do how they gon' scrutinize 'em
And looking at the youth tryna euthanize 'em
If it was up to you they would nuke the projects

Get up off that bed big fella
You a grown boy big fella
You need your diaper change big fella
You still catching a bus nigga and living at mom's crib big fella
You been tryna get money
You only got ten singles in your pocket big fella
Get up now big fella find you a job
Still playing Xbox you ain't even got an Xbox One
Go find you a job today right now big fella
The sun is almost gone big fella
Get up now big fella
Get up big fella
What is you doing 
You been sleeping all day big fella
You ain't even got no pillows or no cover or no sheets on your bed big fella
It's time to find another hustle big fella
That scamming ain't cutting it big fella
Get up now
Get up get up get up big fella
Happy Holidays

She could say in her voice in her way that she love me
With her eyes with her smile with her belt with her hands with her money
I am the thesis of her prayers
Her nieces and her nephews are just pieces of the layers
Only ones she love as much as me is Jesus Christ and Taylor
I got a future so I'm singing for my grandma
You singing too but your grandma ain't my grandma
Mine's is hand made pan fried sun dried
Southside and beat the devil by a landslide
Praying with her hands tied president of my fan club saying to her
Something told me I should bring my butt to church

You gotta move it slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you you're my Sunday candy

Come on in this house 'cause it's gonna rain
 
Rain down Zion it's gonna rain

I come to church for the candy your peppermints is the truth
I'm pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you
You look so good with that hat on had to match with the shoes
Came and dressed in the satin I came and sat in your pew
I come to Christmas for dinner fifty rolls on my plate
Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place
I like my love with a budget I like my hugs with a scent
You smell like light gas water electricity rent
You sound like why the gospel choir got so tired
Singin his praises daily basis so I gotta try it
You're my dreamcatcher dream team captain
Matter fact I ain't seen you in a minute let me take my butt to church

Mama you know Mama you know its gonna rain
Father you know
Promised you said it would rain finally I'm home
You left on the light when I left on the flight but I made it alright
I've been waiting all week I've been waiting all night
Jason Van Dyke
Had to say something on Saturday
See you at Church on Sunday
Open Mike coming on Monday
I wonder what the internet gonna say
Then the third tape slide down the chimney
Via Kirsten Kinsley Lisa Kenny Taylor Wendy Austin win the Emmy Mama Jan too

I wonder if Gladys smiles when angels bring my name up
Or change language and subject change up
Her boy's a long way from red dogs and green rangers
Things ain't been the same since Ms. Patterson called me famous
I saw your reflection in a toilet full of vomit water
But people don't hear ghosts so how they gon' play me
Money saved me so I'ma do the same thing
You droppin pounds gettin small on some sick shit
Like how you got the drive but don't know how to use a stick shift
You better not miss this overdose dope and mixes
Let ya throat close with a boatload of dope quotes within it

Dropping tapes 'til I losted count coughing out blood
Dropping weight like I lost an ounce
Throwing words and tossing nouns
New-York traveling I'm Boston bound bossing 'round homies
And talking down to shorties while I'm jotting down
Notes to spit to Harlem crowns
Surfing through the Harlem crowds
At the crib I'm falling down
Yeah I'm steady crawling 'round
I'm calling out to God
Your little angels falling down
Save me from my darkened cloud
Reach your hands and arms around

Well it's been a long time long time now
Since I've seen you smile
And I'll gamble away my fright
And I'll gamble away my time
And in a year a year or so
This will slip into the sea
Well it's been a long time long time now
 
Since I've seen you smile
 
This is six blunt rotation music
This is just got off six month probation music
This is steppin' on the beach
When you're too drunk to feel a beat
This that laughing in a condo
Throwin' shit down in the street
This that shouts to the Ave shouts to the lab
Shouts to the clucks shouts to the strags
This for every math class that I ever had
So fuck you if I failed and fuck you if I passed 
For shitty summaries and bummers in the past
'Cause some of our teachers act as if summer was for class
Some of us is seeing summer some of us have passed
Some of us ain't seeing summer some of us have passed
So I'm just glad to say I'm sippin' rum up out a glass
'Cause some of us is only sippin' some up off the grav
And heaven's gates look a lot like prison from the Ave

And I just want to roll with my windows down

Another weekend full of blunts and brews
Too comfortable yelling Fuck the school
Ain't seen the world before noon in like a month or two
Blunts to the face bottles to the dome
Niggas never need no cup
Livin' out dreams never givin' hopes up
Ridin' with them Vill niggas never givin' no fucks
In the game tryna get our feel tryna get a deal
Tryna get a million
Just ridin' around with my niggas and them
Real white nigga man mean real appeal
We go all out 'til we fall out
Niggas get called out then hauled out
With the windows down we like to smoke all out
Drink 'til I fall out fuck is you tahm bout boy
The Village is my brothers

For the free train rides shout out to Polk Street
To the ice cream man you just on hella dirt
How you don't see us can't hear us you Helen Keller
But I'mma save my dollars for Mary Jane and embellish her
Inhalin' her smellin' her maybe sellin' her
You niggas got cold feet shouts to Luke Helliker
But that's my homie my dude be droppin' hella verses
Man we out this jam see how new guys do
But its still save money like a coupon

Feed the fishes twist a swisha while I mix the pasta

On the sofa posted perfect selfie picture posture

Stay talking but don't send it up
Used to send it up for my skinner lunch
Save money niggas really won't spend a buck
Gimme that cash that ben what up
Pockets keep that denim

I get sad when I look at the stars
They so pretty you can't tell 'em apart
You think they close but really we far
And really they ain't even that much closer to God
It's much harder to sin naked
I walked past apple trees and didn't take it
I thought about stone mattresses thin blankets
Really long winters spent in a windbreaker
I'm a temptation door-knocker down there on Lower Wacker
I'm a rich excuse for a father you just can't tour a toddler
She turnin' 2 she don't need diapers she just need her papa
I really need a break could really use a nap
My daughter barely recognize me when I lose the hat
You go so far you hit a point where you can't Uber back
The other day I told a hummingbird he too relaxed
I did my worst I did the work I had to skip the label
I go to church they want a flick I want to flip the table
I knew the worth before the birth when it was just a stable
And now it's just a fable and it's just as fatal

First world problems that niggas make up
Have a dream and then never wake up
When so much turns to too much
Have a dream and then never wake up

The day is on its way it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes here it comes yeah
Ready or not ready or not
The day is on its way it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes here it comes
Ready or not here it comes

I think my little cousins want they cousin back
The automatic quarterback that doesn't rap
They know I used to drive to Hammond for the Roman candles
Lied about coming back the last straw that broke the camel
It ain't really fun to hang out with me no more
We can't go to River East to hang at the beach no more
It's messed up I made it this way and my feet so sore
But it's all downhill from here I could teach snowboards
I miss my mom I miss my time I miss my prime
In high school I missed my prom I ditched my date I missed my beat
Kissed my teeth kicked my feet hooped and hollered
Now I just sip my tea sit my ass on my ass
Send my tweet fold my arms twist my weed
If I hadn't heard the news I would've known what he say
But the recliner on my chair is like an emergency brake you know

First world problems that niggas make up
Have a dream and then never wake up
When so much turns to too much
Have a dream and then never wake up

I still ain't get my Grammys in the mail yet
I just want my mama happy like a toy sale
And to stay connected to the world like a long-ass voicemail
I hear the seams snappin' and I'm the team captain
No more knee slappin' or shoe shinin' or shoe signin'
'Til the dream happens I'm just gon' keep rappin'
And y'all just keep clappin' and keep actin' like
Flint got clean water and y'all don't got teen daughters
And black friends and gay cousins y'all just gon' say nothin'
Know that the day comin' knees bowed tongues confessin'
The last ones gettin' first dibs on blessings

Now these the first world problems that niggas make up
Keep on playin' we gon' shake this shit up
Keep on tellin' us we makin' it up
The American Dream may you never wake up

The day is on its way it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes  ready or not ready or not
Ready or not  ready or not ready or not
The day is on its way it will not wait another day
The day is on its way I cannot wait here it's to stay
I'm off the nog I'm off the Loko
I'm off that local I'm on that global
I often had dreams of being locked in my momma's Volvo
Watching the garage burn down I'm off the codo
I'm off the top I'm off some pot I'm off Ciroc
I'm off a lot they gave me ten Days off
That's an awful lot I was off campus but the officer
Told the office that he saw me from the parking lot
But it's all good I'm off that
I'm just finna off his ass off of the Ave while rocking all black
Dip off and hide the garbage bags in the dip spot
Just to make sure that I don't get caught
Buying hella bug spray making sure I get off
They told me go on and rock it I told them that it's lift off
How all my homies get caught picked off by a dick cop
Why you allowing hiccups why you just didn't slip off 
And now I'm at the precinct and I'm off of my square
Having a white cop beat me while he offers me squares
You gon' torture me yeah Well that's awfully fair
All for nothing tryna tweak me like you offering years
Bitch I ain't scared I'm already here
Tell ya partners and ya friends the next coffin is theirs
Guess what bitch I'm from internal affairs
Looking for crooked cops to tweak so I can offer 'em years

Young black boy how he got the labels scared
You gon' set a bad example for the average bear
You a Yogi you should idle while in child's position
I be like naw these my sons this prenatal care
I'mma show em how to make it here and make it fair
Take it there they could kill me and I ain't gon' care
You is just an ankle weight lighter than some angel cake
Sweeter than some maple syrup easier than Ableton
Make a plate and make a player
Make em play it
Just don't count your sheep before they hatch
You chickens before your eggs
Eat your dinner before you say your prayer

I'm back up in this bitch

Young tactician just got my taxes finished
Beat the tortoise by a hair in a Ford Taurus
On a spare with a wax finish
There's a lot of metaphors you just lack vision
You just bad business
All your shit been lower case
Lower class lower key
I'm the only minor minority in priority
Sippin' gin and tonic while I plot upon authority
Author of my horoscope feeling like the oracle
Ain't no rules nigga

I'm back up in this bitch

She working that thing she know she got it
Lil mama so bad you know she naughty
Her do it so slow now watch her take it
She giving a show now watch her break it

Can't nobody do it like you do
True mama sip a little bit of the screw juice
Or a little bit of that Special K
And throw it in the bowl like fruit loops
Hola mami chula
Mami hol'up mami slow up
'Scuse my French my lingo but I no hable cinco
Her girlfriends say they bout it you know that I'm bilingual
And Chano gonna mingle I'm off a couple pintos
The bad hoes out on Saturday it's church on domingo
So while they out her frontin' go on back it for your mans
'Cause even when your friends actin' funny you gon' dance like
Break it down

She working that thing she know she got it
Lil mama so bad you know she naughty
Her do it so slow now watch her take it
She giving a show now watch her break it

Bust it bust it wide open
I been hopin' hopin' shorty goin' goin'
She from lowend oh and went to Kenwood Me too
Nah I'm lyin' she say she got somebody bitch me too
I hope that this shit do work out man
'Cause this that new 'New Workout Plan'
And I'm that dude you heard bout
And I hope that get your shirt off and if not
Keep on dancin' babe all I need is that preview
Put you on the floor and show them niggas how to freak you
Slow whine slow grind
On time you can take your own time
But if I can't hit your ass on time
Gotta hit me online you can't hit my phone line

She working that thing she know she got it
Lil mama so bad you know she naughty
Her do it so slow now watch her take it
She giving a show now watch her break it
I wonder if Gladys smiles when angels bring my name up
Or change language and subject change up
Her boy's a long way from red dolls and green rangers
Things ain't been the same since Ms. Patterson called me famous
I saw your reflection in a toilet full of vomit water
But people don't hear ghost so how they gon' play me
Money saved me so I'ma do the same thing
You droppin' pounds gettin' small on some sick shit
Like how you got the drive but don't know how to use a stick shift 
You better not miss this overdose dope and mix this
Let your throat close with a boatload of dope quotes within it

Dropping tapes 'til I lost the count
Coughing out blood
Dropping weight like I lost an ounce
Throwing words and tossing nouns
New-York traveling I'm Boston bound bossing 'round homies
And talking down to shorties while I'm jotting down
Notes to spit to Harlem crowds
Surfing through the Harlem crowds
At the crib I'm falling down
I'm on the floor crawling 'round
I'm calling out to God
Your little angel's falling down
Save me from my darkened cloud
Reach your hands and arms around

It's been a really really long time
Since a goof ass nigga done tried me
Label niggas wanna sign me
And lame ol' nigga wanna buy me
Food and weed and drink and shit
Just as long as you inkin shit
Sometimes I can't pay for food
'Cause sometimes I can't think of shit
Where's your head at Where's your head at 
Singing my shit like you just said that
Wanging my shit like where'd you hear that 
Young ass nigga where you headed Long time to get famous
Life's whatever you make it just thank God that we made it

Instant pancakes in the morning
Aunt Jemima try to Andre Benjamin me
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson but your daughter do dicks
Wouldn't be my old bitch if you taught her new tricks
But she does the one thing with her tongue ring
When she bust like a gun range
I had a couple pics record her out her panties
But that's just chump change

You know who you is and you know what it is

Your bitches had the ball my bitches pass the ball
And this dick is a gift for that love degree hey
Heard you graduating girl congratulations
This ain't prom but can I take you home as if your fam was waiting
At the front door with that Smith Wesson cocked

Shawty she got the body

Probably gonna do the squaddy
Right after papi
Sloppy she extra choppy
Just did the potty
I love that bitch the perfect thottie
The perfect thottie
Heads bowed for the curly haired sons of Abraham

Chance The Rapper song singer senior bong steamer
Light up hot wheels locked up wrong steamer
Dreamer long Beemers our neighbors their lawns greener
We wrestle with envy then act up John Cena
Chancellor Bennett referred to as word chemist
The bourbon and slurred sentences is turning up burning bridges
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young just turned older than him
Getting hyped up off them bad bitches on it
Getting knocked up off a nigga bad luck
Getting scared now with them IRS audits
All the tax money that I didn't add up
That I didn't get yet but they think that I got it
Keep a long shirt so they think that I got it
And if they all dummy and a nigga get bodied
It was really ill I know a nigga held up
Hell yeah I'll always get a pic with y'all niggas
Word to my fans all six of y'all niggas
I seen all the tweets and the tips from y'all niggas
Got hands for them niggas that pick on y'all niggas
Loving your love an album to come
I bet that you love it comes out in a month
Chance the astounding class clown
That turned out to amount into something

I count my blessings too often
My best friends on one hand
My sheep when I'm done here
Gotta get up get up
I count my blessings too often
My best friends on one hand
My sheep when I'm done here
Gotta get up get up

Knock knock said the fist to the world
Shine sun through the mist and debris
Bang bang said the fist to the young
Silence from the lips of the free
Say something important say something important
Make money the end of the week
But that shit coming soon I'm getting hungry
Might sell out in a couple of weeks
But my crib they buckin'
And they just called Buddy that's lil bro
Even though last time we spoke
We was arguing but we still stay close
Ask God to watch the squad
On God battle niggas to the death alright
Fuck your squad and the whole facade
I ain't never scared of where a nigga reside
Extra mild sauce on the side extra mileage on the ride
Express I'mma grab my chain
'Cause it's extra violence all on the nine
Ten days that's an awful lot
Eleven squares in like fifteen minutes
Sixteens when that album comes
Spit twelve real quick for a listening picnic igh 

I count my blessings too often
My best friends on one hand
My sheep when I'm done here
Gotta get up get up
I count my blessings too often
My best friends on one hand
My sheep when I'm done here
Gotta get up get up

Everyday when you're walking down the street 
Everybody that you meet
Has an original point of view

It's a simple message
And it comes from the heart
Believe in yourself
For that's the place to start

And I said Hey 
What a wonderful kind of day
We can learn to work and play
Get along with each other

Listen to your heart
Listen to the beat
Listen to the rhythm
The rhythm of the street
Open up your eyes
Open up your ears
Get together and make things better
By working together

I'm gonna get by when the going get rough
I'm gonna love life 'til I'm done growing up
And when I go down
I'mma go down swinging
My eyes still smiling
And my heart still singing
Yolo nigga yolo everything
Yolo car yolo car radio
Look me up in the yolo pages nigga igh

Hey Ya When the fuck you gonna grow up 
When that money gonna show up 
Thought that ten Day shit would blow up
Got you stressed ripping your 'fro up
Smokin' squares fuckin' your throat up
And a nigga from your iPod in the party and they know ya
And your teachers wanna claim ya they critically acclaim ya
Used to criticize your mistakes
You the reason for the mishaps and should keep coming up missing
You're a top dog you the top dog
They can't even catch up you so hot dog
And it feels good and it feels dope
You still steal shit 'cause you still broke
And you really wanna drop really really hot
Shit that they really wanna cop but they wouldn't give a fuck
If you won a Grammy if you end up in the Hall of Rock
Then you end up in a hole from a hammy to the top
Got ninety-nine problems got a hundred to the drugs
I should finish up this verse but you know I don't give a fuck

Shouts out my juice bitch my cup runneth over
Bout now them suits fit my cuffs button golden
So bitch suck my dick igh bitch suck my dack
I been riding 'round in that steamer with that steamer in my lap
I swear I used to give a fuck but now I give a fuck less
What do I think of success What do you think of fuck fest 
You ever had a foursome You ever been a suspect 
You ever passed the fuck out You ever failed a drug test 
I learned from getting bumped that bumping Ye could make it be okay
All that jumping dunking shit can't make a 3 go way
I been up inside the stu' for fucking three whole days
Yelling Fuck the cops it ain't nothing to box
So somebody pour me another shot like shots
We need time

You reach into the bowl of car keys
Are you fucking happy now
Grab his wrist and wriggle past me
As Jenny licks her lips
Time to teach a young dog tricks
And how to bow
Remember when you couldn't hurt me
We reached a breaking point
As you lit your joint and we crossed the severn bridge
For the addy and your cold out splow me out

She know my favorite flavor skittles
She know everything we argue 'bout
Where everything in our crib at
And every time you walk up out
She know whenever we fighting and whenever we cool
But my favorite thing she know is that she'll never be you
She know she'll never have her song She know she'll never have my son
She know she'll never have your pain she'll never have to have a hunch
She know everyone that I lie about heard every freaking word
She know everything you wonder bout and it hurt her even worse
Who'd you rather be 
All and all gold is not reality
Real is what you lays on me
How's everybody doing 

We were all that matters family's all that matters
This is just business see you right after
Nothing comes before ya nothing else matters
All of this is for ya you are all that matters

I dance around the darkness down on Billie Jean Road
If I ain't toured then we still'd be broke
Thought I got the formula bon appetite
I got a beat in case my baby baba ever leak
Wise beyond my years but way behind my peak
You gotta eat this a step to my princess
Point of interest fourth and inches
Hallelujah the kid grew up the crowd cheered the child
Booya mic drop I walk home

I got the baddest chick on the planet
She ain't mixed but folks be askin' if she half Hispanic
She complain about the baby weight but I ain't panicked
Since she got pregnant she been showin' crack like bad mechanics
I rub her feet I put in work like I was Robyn Fenty
The only chick that I hold as much is probably Kinsley
I sit with her and watch Black Ink and Being Mary
She stand about six feet she used to hoop at 'Lane
I tried to stick her the other day and got my ankle sprained
I fell deep tried to leave but you know the way that you learn best
Is leavin' out the garage and get hit with that U-turn text
So if you got a girl and she sexy and she grown
Stay your ass at home before you end up all alone
Leave the toilet seat down always keep your phone
Ask my girlfriend she got her own ringtone and she was singing
I've got a lady a lady friend
And that lady is my friend
I've got I've got a lady for a friend

I'm your buddy I'm your little bro
I'm a stuffed animal
I'm a cuddle not a dildo
I'm a love anecdote
Was I always taller than ya 
Will I always call ya back 
I'mma always wrongly answer
Always almost caught ya trap
Few compliments and a tear wipe
I'm the best man you're not marrying
And you know they ask about you
What's up with your lady

You just a black man in this world
You just a barcode ayy
You just a black man in this world
Drivin' expensive foreigns ayy
You just a big dawg yeah
I kenneled him in the backyard
No probably ain't life to a dog
I wake up feeling like you won't play right
I used to know but now that shit don't feel right
It made me put away my pride so long
You made a nigga wait for some so long
You make it hard for boy like that to go on
I'm wishing I could make this mine oh

How'd it get so scandalous but stay woke
No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas

Hold up wait a minute all good just a week ago
Crew at my house and we party every weekend so
On the radio that's my favorite song
Make me bounce around like I don't know like I won't be here long
Now the thrill is gone got no patience 'cause I'm not a doctor
Girl why is you lying girl why you Mufasa
Yeah mi casa su casa got it stripping like Gaza
Got so high off volcanoes now the flow is so lava
Yeah we spit that saliva iPhone got message from Viber
Either the head is so hydra or we let bygones be bygones
Got a house full of homies why I feel so the opposite 
Incompetent ain't the half of it
Saturdays we're Young Lavish-ing
Saddest shit is I'm bad as it
Beans they took from the cabinet 
Sorry I'm just scared of the future

No matter what you say or what you do
When I'm alone I'd rather be with you
Fuck these other niggas
I'll be right by your side till the last days

I used to care what people thought but now I care more
I mean nobody out here's got it figured out
So therefore I've lost all hope of a happy ending
Depending on whether or not it's worth it so insecure no one's perfect
We spend it with no shame we blow that like Coltrane
We in here like Rogaine or leave it like Cobain
And when I'm long gone whole crew sing a swan song
'Cause we all just ticking time bombs got a Lambo like LeBron's mom
And no matter where all of my friends go Emily Fam and Lorenzo
All of them people my kinfolk at least I think so can't tell
'Cause when them checks clear they're not here
'Cause they don't care it's kinda sad but I'm laughing whatever happens
Assassins are stabbed in the back of my cabin
Labrador yapping I'm glad that it happened I mean it
Between us I think there's something special and if I lose my mental
Just hold my hand even if you don't understand hold up

Watching haters wonder why Gambino got the game locked
Half-Thai thickie all she wanna do is Bangkok
Got her hair done French braids now she A$AP

Different color my passport Instagram my stack load

And I'm born rich life ain't fair yeah It's silver spoon coon ho

Year off got no rules tripping off of them toadstools
More green than my Whole Foods and I'm too fly Jeff Goldblum
Got a glass house in the Palisade
White hood white hood ok
Furniture custom you shop at IKEA
Show Maserati you whipping a Kia
Spending this money it's longer than Nia
Live like a Coppola me and Sofia
Waking up broke man wouldn't wanna be ya
Friends with the dopeman help a nigga rise
Bring a girlfriend man trouble when I see her
Oh I got my cool on
I'm winning so they had to dump the Gatorade
And I don't give a fuck about my family name 

Don't be mad 'cause I'm doing me better than you doing you
Better than you doing you fuck it what you gon' do  
Okay it's Childish Gambino homegirl drop it like the NASDAQ

Hot like a parked car

Fly like the logo on my cousin's four hundred forty
Eatin' Oreos like these white girls that blow me
Vodka for my ladies whiskey for a grown man
Hangin' in the islands lookin' for Earl like Toejam

Butcher and I know it man kill beef go ham

I like black girls who nerdy but when they dance they be sayin'
Chillin' with a Filipina at your local Jollibee
Yeah I'm in her ass like sodomy
So if you see my hand under the table don't bother me
I don't talk soft that's that other guy
The shit I'm doin' this year Insanity
Made the beat then murdered it Casey Anthony
These rappers don't know what to do
'Cause all I did was act me like a Looney Tune
And I'll give you all of me until there's nothing left
I swear this summer will be summer Camp bitch
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around can't speak
I can't speak
I wanted you to know
That I am ready to go heartbeat
My heartbeat
I wanted you to know
Whenever you are around can't speak
I can't speak

I know what your boy like
Skinny tie and a cuff type
He go and make breakfast
You walk around naked
I might just text you
Turn your phone over when it's all over
No settling down my text go to your screen
You know better than that
I come around when you least expect me
I'm sitting at the bar when your glass is empty
You thinking that this song's coming on to tempt me
I need to be alone like the way you left me
You start calling you start crying
I come over I'm inside you
I can't find you the girl that I once had
But the sex that we have isn't half bad
The text say that It's not fair
And I'm flirtin' with this new girl
And I'm callin' if it don't work
So we fuck till we come to conclusions
All the things that we thought we were losing
I'm a ghost and you know this
That's why we broke up in the first place

I wanted you to know that I am ready to go heartbeat
I wanted you to know whenever you are around I can't speak

It's late night Thursday
I know that you heard me
But you don't want the same thing
Well two can play that game
So I'm chilling with my girlfriend
But she not my real girlfriend
She got a key to my place but
She's not my real girlfriend
Say the wrong thing and wrong girls come runnin'
I'm paranoid that these girls want something from me
And it's hard to make a dime go one hundred
And my dude freakin' out over a worse fate
She on time but she late for they first date
'Cause he went and tried out a new condom
Slipped off in a threesome good problems 
Askin' him if she wanna play games
With the Super Smash Brothers but none of them you
I miss the sex when you kiss whenever you through
Sixty-nine is the only dinner for two
I was wrong but would you have listened to you 
I got a heart but the artichoke
Is the only thing girls want when you in that smoke

So we're done This the real shit 
We used to hold hands like field trips
I'm a jerk but your dude is a real dick
I read his post on your wall and I feel sick
He ain't cool he ball and all that
But he just a fake nigga who blog in all caps
You couldn't wait to date
I'm going straight for your thighs like the cake you ate
I give a fuck about the niggas that you say you ate
You know that I'm the best when I'm a-fake-tionate
I'm the best that you had face it
J and Keyshia are related racist
I give you money then you burn me then you made off
She ain't a killer but she'd fucking blow your head off
I know he wondering What the fuck you hiding
That we dated like raps about Bin Laden
Are we dating or are we fucking
Are we best friends Are we something In between that 
I wish we never fucked and I mean that
 
Alright Gambino is a mastermind fuck a bitch to pass the time

Rappers wanna battle me I have to mail their heads back
And my clique make that dinero so it's time to meet the fuckers
I am runnin' this bitch you are just a dog walker
Leavin' with your girl when we last seen each other
Yeah you fuckin' with the baddest like we tag team Rihanna
Fly girl on her knees she don't wanna come near me
Yeah my dick is too big there's a big bang theory
Got her picture in my iPhone what do y'all think 
While y'all niggas masturbate I'm in that Ariel Pink
If I am just a rapper man you could've fooled me
I'm the shit when these dudes talk they talkin' bull me ah

Alright I'm down with the black girls of every single culture
Filipino Armenian girls on my sofa
Yeah I like a white girl sometimes we get together
Need a thick chick though
So it's black and yellow black and yellow
Love is a trip but fuckin' is a sport
Are there Asian girls here Minority report
Put your team on the map Blake Griffin on the court
Niggas bitin' off my tracks need a knife and a fork
We the illest need a nurse here's the check grab your purse
Unless we fuckin' then I'll pay for all the food on the Earth man
I got some pussy that was insane
So insane it's an enemy of Batman
I'm dominant niggas call me faggot 'cause they closeted
I'm hot as shit comin' out the backside of a rocket ship
It's monster shit you dudes are the opposite of Loch Nesses
Respond to this we can squash the beef right now like sausages
Chillin' with my n-words say it like a white kid
Yes your booty's big as hers say that to my white bitch
So she don't get embarrassed my dick is made of carrots
Bunnies wantin' to be fed it I meant honeys oh forget it
I have worked all winter I will not fail summer
In the back of a bush like Gavin Rossdale's drummer
Yeah my stinger's in her flower I hope she let me pollinate
Workin' hard as shit yeah this beat is made from concentrate
Nigga can't you tell that my sample of Adele
Was so hot I got these hood niggas blowin' up my cell 
Swag out the ass I'm the man fuck chico
Took the G out your waffle all you got left is your ego
Think about it for a second

An elephant never forgets so my dick remembers everything
Green inside your wallet is that pussy open sesame
Runnin' the game fuck am I sayin' 
Runnin' the Earth give me a month
Told all you niggas I'm in it to win it
'Cause havin' an Emmy just wasn't enough
You get sloppy drunk I stay whiskey neat
My clique should be cancelled Freaks and Geeks
Got some brand-new music
I need y'all to turn it up and let me know what you think

Rich kid but he act like a gentleman
Last one didn't end like it should've been
Two dates and he still wanna get it in
And they're saying it's because of the Internet
Try her once and it's on to the next chick
And we can do the same thing if you wanna have at it
When your thoughts can't breathe and you thinking asthmatic
And you wanna be a mom and I wasn't mad at it
I was thinking 'bout me I'd be really bad at it
'Cause I'm thinking 'bout me weeks in Dubai
Fourth of July house in Kauai yeah we can try

I took off my nine to five
But you still don't have the time to kiss me just hit me
And if I left you all alone would you still pick up the phone 
It's iffy you miss me
I got furniture to move
And we'll both be thirty soon
In Oakland in Oakland
The only one I know is you so the fuck I'm supposed to do 
In Oakland in Oakland
All she needed was some

At a Clippers game on the courtside 
Watch a nigga shoot like a four-five 
They mad at me too I got more fire
When these bitches see you Go home Roger
 
Tia and Tamara in my bed I'm a smart guy
I ain't fucking with you niggas like apartheid 
Hits on my list check my archive
I'm something so immaculate instead of asking what's happening
Rather blast a Jackson 5 in the back of an Acura
Acting blacker than a Bernie Mac two Charlie Murphys and Akon
The girls that you brought man where are they from 
Where are they from We were playing PlayStation
Why you standing there Say some
Girl say some no this ain't a vacation
This is my house my house all she needed was some

When I ball I'ma ball King James nigga
Uncle Ben in my hand make change nigga
And I'm out of this world like Tang nigga
That's a space bar man I hate y'all
You only come around
When you wanna play pool or my hot tub
Ice cream paint job in the garage
I had a menage and murdered the vag'
But afterwards it was awkward as fuck
'Cause I'm nervous as fuck and could not get it up
I need a minute cold water to the face
I couldn't finish got the Uber from her place
On my porch smoking vapor hit with the Sunday paper
Listening to the neighbors

I watch these haters take they shots like they were alcoholics
If I'm a faggot spell it right I got way more than two G's
Nigga I'm amazing I'm a phenom
I'm assassin I'mma kill y'all
And this shit's closed now 'cause I ball too hard
And I'm cumming on her face have I gone too far 
I don't know who cares I don't love that broad
And it's funny how these fake niggas always act hard
I'm a black star in a black car with a black card
They wanna knock me out
They tryin nigga
Realest motherfucker in the game like Tron nigga
Forget these white girls
I need some variation
Especially if she very Asian
She got an ugly friend Roll solo
Can I stay at your place No hobo
Not my fault man these ladies love me
She's an overachiever 'cause all she do is succeed

I'm on my ballin' each and every day
You see me babe You see me babe

Texting with Olivia Munn hopefully she'll give me some
Or some Rosie Jones man
Hoes is hoes is hoes man
Racks on racks on racks man
All I got is tracks man
Sorry for my accent but I've been practicin'
Everywhere ya go niggas blastin' that Gambino
Met this fly Latino
Hope that she eighteen though
If she not I'll say that I got deep throat in Heathrow

Told me I was shit but that shit couldn't stop me
Nigga still hungry black Kobayashi
When I talk about you I hear who's this like Horton
I was born for this shit you a rappin' abortion
Can we hear the N-word one day and not get upset 
Can we try something new and not be suspect 
I don't really know we fucked up bad
You don't wanna see my dudes when they get mad
I got a bunch of jackanapes at the back of me
That'll lacerate anyone in the back of a matinee
And laugh while they masturbatin' all over your beaten body
Sick Boi forever that Suburban Illuminati

Can't stand it backhanded
They wanna see us falling apart
You know that I love you
So let me into you

Let me into your heart
This is the end of us
Sleeping with the moon and the stars
I know where you've been
You can see the sun

Let me into your heart
Oh this ain't no bullshit
I really love you girl

Girl you really got a hold on me
So this isn't just puppy love

I'm in love when we are smokin' that
Girl you really got a hold woo
And now that's it's over I'll never be sober
I couldn't believe but now I'm so high

Girl what's your problem
'Cause I know it's hard sometimes baby just give it some time
Oh honey now girl we can solve them
If you just give me some time I can open up your mind
If you let it shine you can free your mind

Girl if it's done right
Well you know it's got to be something wonderful to me
Oh honey now girl give it one night
If you just give it a chance loving you is not my plan
'Cause I know one day you'll see
All the things that we can be
 
Rec League I ain't paying to ball
Y'all B-string like a broke guitar
And I still put it down like the family dog
Yeah I murder some murder one
Explain it all Ferguson
We ain't gotta sing the same old love song
Cut a white girl with the same black gloves on
Yeah what you saying to it 
Old money look no money don't do it
Make 'em turn around in their lane like a U-line
And I'm only looking back if I'm looking at her booty what's the rationale
They wanna smoke niggas when they black and mild

Blue dream by the bouquet
'Til I'm blue-faced on a Tuesday
Can I have some #NiggasBeLike
And I said what I felt no re-write
Nah nah they can't hold me
I double dare you I'm Marc Summers
I scorch winters I burn autumns
Gut niggas so Kurt Vonne
Elle Varner got a crush on her
I gotta wait in line for that
Ain't nobody got time for that
Ain't nobody gotta rhyme with that
Too true like it's 2 Chainz
Blue blood like he both gangs

Where we were kinda thing
When we were coming down they said it was too soon
When we were coming down they left us all alone
We're headed nowhere
I know you've been around I feel you in and out
How are you Do you sleep Are you with me 
We used to be unspoken
Now everything is broken I'm a good son
You're a good son

Arlanda hotel to the bar
Young girl with an accent with her back bent
Ass out to the whole world
We can vibe out for tonight
Stepping outside for a light
No coke and I just smoke vapor no papers
Slow poke and I don't know 'bout photos
Let's go though
How old are you 
Saying that you never date older dudes
That's why I never wanna say no to you
The coldest dude to hold a groove with no kids
The coldest dude who can't hold his goose 
I'ma walk out wanna walk too
What about dude 
Fuck him I just really wanna feel something

It took me like five minutes to figure out
What the voices those were on the phone
But I figured it out

Is it real 'cause you're online 

I'm a freaky bitch
And I am a freaky bitch

Heathen it's a struggle just to keep breathing
Existential asthmatic puff puff pass addict
Craftmatic making moves but they sleeping on me
We can kick it like it's FIFA homie nevertheless
I got that fresh like it was Crest grind 'cause I'm stressed
I never understood the hate on a nigga preference
When every marriage is a same sex marriage
Same sex everyday monotonous Lost God never pray
Forgotten us lost love never say just like our parents
Too much power ain't enough power
Brain splattered like I've fallen off a watch tower
And anybody can walk into any Denny's
And wait 'til I'm walking in it with a gun that they 3D printed and finish it
Kinison said if you gonna miss Heaven
Why do it by two inches Old money and new bitches
Old money and new bitches

Getting next level in a hotel
Ain't shit that we don't need nigga oh well
Fuck outta here dog  wassup wassup
Don't don't try to jump me
Don't try to jump me fool
You got it I ain't even wanna fight homies
 
Worldstar before rap you already know that
So Fresh Prince they about to bring the show back
Listening to Kilo weekend cost a kilo
Hair so long I'm about to bring the fro back
Girlfriend actin' all wishy-washy 
It's your birthday make it earthquake
Fell in love with a nigga like a mermaid
That's a first date uhh
Nobody think about it worst case uhh
Best case we the front page uhh
Ten thousands on the first day uhh
Yeah mothafucka take your phone out
To record this ain't nobody can ignore this
I'm more or less a moral-less individual
Making movies with criminals tryin' to get them residuals
When it all go crazy
When I hear that action I'ma be Scorsese
My nigga hold it horizontal man be a professional
Damn my nigga be a professional what you doing man 

My girl ain't bad she more like evil
When I'm lookin' in the mirror how fly's this negro 
She on Hollywood and Vine thinkin' that she Hollywood on Vine
Makin' movies with her friends all the time
Showin' off her ass that's a net twerk 
But I saw through it like a wet shirt 
Drive slow 'cause you might swerve off it
Still eat and the hate so salty
Put shrooms in my roommate's coffee
And got more likes than a white girl talking
More hits than a fight comp
Where they fight cops 'til they stop when I heard shots
Watching dude drop from a Glock
Let me flash on 'em we all big brother now
Lil' sis let her run around
Money talking you know the sound 

So CG but a nigga stay real
Though I'm fly I'm ill I'm running shit
Rappers used to laugh like I tripped and fell
'Cause I don't stunt a gold cross like I Christian bail
Yeah they starin' at me jealous 'cause I do shows bigger
But your looks don't help like an old gold digger
Uncool but lyrically I'm a stone cold killer
So it's gfour hundreds blows to these Truffaut niggas
Yeah now that's the line of the century
Niggas missed it too busy they lyin' 'bout penitentiary
Man you ain't been there nigga you been scared
And I'm still living single like Synclaire
Lovin' white dudes who call me white and then try to hate
When I wasn't white enough to use your pool when I was 8
Stone Mountain you raised me well
I'm stared at by Confederates but hard as hell
Tight jeans penny loafers but I still drink a four dime
Staying on my me shit but hated on by both sides
I'm just a kid who blowing up with my father's name
How many gold plaques you want inside your dining room 
I said I want a full house
They said You got it dude

All these haters See you later
All that I could do But you dont even feel me though

Got flow I could make a cripple crip walk
Niggas' breath stank all they do is shit talk
People want a real man I made 'em wait this long
Maybe if he bombs he'll quit and keep actin'
And save paper like your aunt does with McDonald napkins
How'd it happen Honesty did it
See all of my competition at the bodies exhibit
Yeah I bodied the limits and I deaded them fakers
Motherfuck if you hate it cremated them haters
So my studio be a funeral
Yeah this is our year oh you didn't know 
Uh yeah I'm killin' you step inside the lion's den
Man I'm hov if the 'O' was an 'I' instead
On stage with my family in front of me
I am what I am everything I wanna be

All these haters
See you later
All that I could do
But you dont even feel me though
I know you know I know you got that power
That power

This is on a bus back from camp
I'm thirteen and so are you
Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes
I hadn't met yet running around all summer getting into trouble
It turned out it would be me and just one girl That's you
And we're still at camp as long as we're on the bus
And not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us
We're still wearing our orange camp t-shirts We still smell like pineneedles
I like you and you like me and I more-than-like you
But I don't know if you do or don't more-than-like me
You've never said so I haven't been saying anything all summer
Content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me
And choosing to do so again the next day and so on
A girl who's smart and funny and who if I say something dumb for a laugh
Is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh
But who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be
A girl who reads books that no one's assigned to her
Whose curly brown hair has a line running through it
From where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet
Back in the real world we don't go to the same school
And unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood
We won't go to the same high school
So this is kind of it for us Unless I say something
And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something
The sun's gone down and the bus is quiet A lot of kids are asleep
We're talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop
That looks like a kid we know
And all of a sudden I'm telling you
And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming
And your face is there and gone and there and gone
As we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway
And there's no expression on it
And I think just after a point I'm just talking to lengthen the time
I don't know exactly what you mean by it but it seems vaguely positive
And I would leave in order not to spoil the moment
But there's nowhere to go because we're on a bus
So I pretend like I'm asleep and before long I really am
I wake up the bus isn't moving anymore
The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on
I turn and you're not there
Then again a lot of kids aren't in their seats anymore
We're parked at the pick-up point which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church
The bus is half empty You might be in your dad's car by now
Your bags and things piled high in the trunk
The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time
Disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus
Just as one of them reaches my row
It used to be our row on our way off
It's Michelle a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week
After throwing rocks at my head
Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise
She stops and looks down at me
And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light so I can't really see her face
Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh
And then she turns and leads them off the bus
I didn't know you were friends with them
I find my dad in the parking lot He drives me back to our house and camp is over
So is summer even though there's two weeks until school starts
This isn't a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad
This is a story about how I learned something and I'm not saying this thing is true or not
I'm just saying it's what I learned
I told you something It was just for you and you told everybody
So I learned cut out the middle man make it all for everybody always
Everybody can't turn around and tell everybody already knows I told them
But this means there isn't a place in my life for you or someone like you
Is it sad Sure But it's a sadness I chose
I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy
And got off a man more cynical hardened and mature and shit
But that's not true The truth is I got on the bus a boy And I never got off the bus
I still haven't flied

Man made the Web you don't need a name
Man made of faults I ain't too ashamed
Every thought I had put it in a box 
Everybody see it just before the cops
Rick Rolling these niggas they mad 'cause they don't know any better
Real deep hope they dig a nigga before they bury me
Even though we were told to go where they wouldn't go
Hella slow that's that dial up watch it pile up fly

We are the dreams of our parents lost in the future
Who hide the deepest desires and wear a mask
Door open we were smoking in the hotel
The vapors went through the hallway the manager pissed as hell
I mean where's the line between Donnie G and Gambino 
He hang with girls like he Lena but needed some time to re-up
Tequila in the cantina thirty dollars I swallowed
You been doing this for too long
That Camp was a million years ago sing me a different song
Whether you're trolling or controlling just a reminder
You think you get it you don't it's that Andrew Auernheimer
I'm gone and now I'm back
Give a fuck or give 'em hell just not a chance to react
Tyler Durden this burden hurting they said there was curtains
Certain demise look in his eyes the pain inadvertent
I could've stayed where I was and have a life you'd be proud of
But I'd rather chase things never thought of
It was all love saying Go hard
Making dope it's a trap Ackbar backfired
Panic dreams so it seems we're meant to die
Had to get some stuff off my chest I vaporized
High on my own it took time to realize
Because the internet mistakes are forever
But if we fuck up on this journey at least we're together
Man I wish I could go back and tell that kid it's make-believe
Make 'em believe in themselves people who needed my help
Feelings I felt keeling myself no one's ever been this lost
I just get the information retweet it or say it sucks
I just got the motivation your talent's just bunch of luck
Hard work and dedication but lately it's run amok
Waking up in these places I don't remember
Texts from people I never met doors left open
I don't know who I am anymore
Still on the beat though
Still in the game but he moves with a cheat code
Slowest connection ever my life inside a computer
Them bands that'll make 'em dance my wallet's Lollapalooza
The violence first-person shooter
First person to move first person to speak
My mils aren't meek they scream in the streets
Losing my frame of reference these pieces of shit for breakfast
Funny the day you're born that's really your death sentence
I met this girl at a dinner we conversating
She beautiful in the face but her voice is truly amazing
Plus she write her own shit becoming so close knit
Smoke up and talk in the evening she helping me focus
No Anna Nicole Smith she getting hers
Niggas take her props like a musical live and learn
She say she feel alone all the time I'm similar
I meet her in my dreams on the moon I visit her
Every night I text her I wanna solve the world I think I need your help
She text me How you gon' trust somebody when you don't trust yourself
I mean she right though forty-five like a light-bulb
And I could've died like my iPhone but I kept going like a psycho
And I took chance like a dice roll dropping jewels like it's puberty
Never forget this feeling never gon' reach a million
Eventually all my followers realize they don't need a leader
Stay on your own shit fuck what these clones think
Just remember that you the shit but act like it don't stink
We were childish but had to grow up
When you spitting real shit eventually you throw up
Realities like allergies I'm afraid to go nuts
Life's the biggest troll but the joke is on us
Yeah the joke's you showed up

A New York nine's an everywhere else six
Timewise the opposite goes for chicks
I'm in a taxi texting with my best friend
He's sleeping with this girl that he met up on West End
He's lucky she's a career woman no kids
Most girls see the clothes and try and gold dig
Most hoes poke holes in Trojans
Most people don't fuck and hit the lotto but my folks did
I'm a mess
That don't rhyme with shit it's just true
Don't bring your girlfriend here it's just you
When I'm depressed you're someone I run to
But I guess meet me at Pianos
They cross-fadin' off of Nanos
Ugh on that hipster shit
And you's a hipster bitch
Yo but not in the lame way
Like you ain't workin' on a screenplay
Like your baby daddy ain't a DJ
Like she listenin' to old Freeway
'Cause everybody listens to Biggie but she different
Right that's why your friends need wristbands 
Fuck you Can I have this dance 

We could pretend if you want to like
We in love and started datin' at your art school
'Cause either way we both lyin' more than half of the time
Except for when I'm home workin' on your graphic design
Every time we see each other I'm takin' you home
Our relationship has gotten Sylvester Stallone
But me writin' a verse would be the only way they buyin' a bar
White boys used to trip and send me over a gin
But they busy showin' off each other Indian friend
She got ironic tattoos on her back
That ain't ironic bitch I love Rugrats
Watchin' lames handle they fame
They bang any broad with bangs
In a band with an animal name
Hannibal came drinkin' a handle of Jameson
Anallin' anyone is the plan for the evening
I'm kidding stop
Girl cryin' on Ludlow
She still look good though
Love is Eastside who are you to hate 
You ain't see me at the show I was super great
Hotel penthouse go on and let it ruminate
City never sleeps so I guess I'm never slept on
Did everything I could then I kept goin'

Face down in the brown grass
Shame on my brown ass
Birds in the trees as we run through
And if I'm dead to the world what you gon' do
Shots fired rewind please girl be mine
Email denied talk to me baby
Before I go crazy might do it maybe
We were so Jay Z and Beyonce my aunt say keep the sex game picante
The Aunt May and Mary Jane that I was hitting on
To make me try and forget that there was something wrong
Love is Russian roulette I had the safety on
We popped pills at the Coachella
Hold my head in the weeds man I can't tell her
The fear that I feel man it might kill her
Man it might kill her it's the prep school mic killa'
With the drums and the groove so it feel Dilla
I don't care what he say
I'ma get my platinum back like I'm a half ton gorilla
You can hang with homie on the low
But your boy so weak like a week ago
But we ain't speaking though
We ain't speaking we ain't speaking though

Tuesday afternoon I ain't got shit to do
But fall in love with you 
Love me better kiss me back Listen more oh

I hope you understand 'Cause everywhere I go
Everything I see I just hope you understand
Alright it's Childish baby Mr. talk about his dick again
Nerdy-ass black kid whatever man I'm sick of him
That well-spoken token who ain't been heard
The only white rapper who's allowed to say the N-word
I buy a bunch of 'em and put it on my black card
Now I got some street cred use it 'til it's maxed out
I got a girl on my arm dude show respect
Something crazy and Asian Virginia Tech
She too fine I do dimes
If not that I'm walking out with two fives
Change my ID for the cops it's not enough yet
Black male in short shorts I'm double suspect
Ballin' since eighty-three half of 'em say he gay
Maybe that's the reason I like Lady What-babies-say
I'm a problem I'm lame as fuck homie
But I rap like these niggas ain't got shit on me
Fuck the cool kids not Chuck Inglish
But people who think that hatin on me makes them distinguished
You better shut your mouth before I fuck it
You really hate my lyrics now or Kid Cudi's Nigga

Runnin this thing money insane
Busy getting brain like Krang

Nigga got signed it's an anomaly
No cosign trigonometry
Man these niggas hate me
Man fuck you niggafuck you nigga
They real black like won't show up on your camera phone
They real black like turn the flash on your camera on
They real black take shit turn it into gold
I'm real black I survive when the pressure on
Upper echelon bit my lip when I'm kissin' her
Clash of the Titans baby your tits is titular
Listenin to some Kiss FM she wanna hear Nicki Minaj
Super Bass super face inside a garage
It's not a massage spa rap with a happy ending
Old niggas wanna assassinate me
It's a shame these kids was supposed to save rap
Fuck that boat shoes and a wave cap
He don't give back how the fuck a nigga say that 
Summer in November I gave everyone a Maybach
Comin' on that payback comin' on that mace took
I'm comin' on that real shit I'm comin' on her Facebook
Fuck a backpacker with a rhino's dick
I do me like a gyno chick

Runnin this thing money insane
Busy getting brain like Krang
In the woods got these niggas usin' Mapquest
Man fuck these backpackers
Fuck these backpackers
I had a dream I was flying over all of us
There were so many pretty people so many pretty faces
I talked to some birds I fell in love again
And none of this ever ended
Everything just kept going and going and going
And even when you laughed you cried
And even when you were sad you were really happy
'Cause you were here and I got to meet every star
Every planet everything that made me
And we all kissed and became the same

Who would have thought this We almost lost it
When you lie inside darkness it's hard to see
And we sleep in tradition keep 'em off in the distance
To tell you that I haven't been

We are all cold water
Why try at all Why bother 
Just hold me close my darling

Who would have dreamed this You couldn't mean this
It would be some type of meanness to where you are
'Cause I don't know where to go
And no one else seems to know

We are all night's fallen
Why try at all Dark calling
So we're left alone no one left to call upon
Be still now broken bones as I travel on

Just hold me close my darling

So we're left alone no one left to call upon
Be still now broken bones as I travel on
Just hold me close my darling

Oh we gon' have a party
All my friends will be there
We drink all the vodka
There's music everywhere
Now wait a minute 
Do you like to party 
'Cause if you don't  Don't come over here
We got smoking Drinking  fucking
I wanna show you what it is

Thought I was done but that wasn't the case
Got a new stack that I threw in your face
Got a new girl and she look Mila Kunis
Infinity pool and a statue that's Buddhist
Got bottles and bottles and bottles of Grino
Saw I was rich now they fucking with 'Bino
Brown leather bag the vacation Messina
The boat in the harbor I rule the marina
Ten grands for the drinks now they say I'm insane
It's been that for a minute now Hedi Slimane
I been black lucrative since Danity Kane
Who came back for a minute now everything changed
High as a kite lime in the light
Y'all niggas might whine every night
I ain't invite all these people to my mothafuckin' house

Let 'em speak I know I'm meek but the mills louder
Watch the throne kings kill when the prince feels power
It's the real deal Holyfield holy shit holy grail
Silver spoon coon young buffoon yeah they know me well
I'm makin' moves couldn't lose doin' Parker Lewis
Hot on my own self-immolate I could be a Buddhist
Hot on my own check your tone check your stance homie
You don't even like me you just trynna get my fans homie
So nerdy but the flow wordy
Brain-freezin' with the flow slurpie
Ice cold but you know I burn cash like I had herpes
Not true but I'm that dirty
Niggas quit bein' hot man cold turkey
While I'm out in Kauai man soul searchin'
And these niggas be afraid and I'm so certain
'Cause they don't know what to do when the world's broken
A lot of people try and go and talk shit but your girl stops me on the street
Like it's stop and frisk and a bunch of fags wanna talk a lot of shit
But that's cool 'cause in the real world they really don't exist
It's all because the internet
Chance made millions Haim made millions
Dan made millions Kendrick made millions
I would too if I wasn't in my feelings

You know 'cause like people say money's not everything
But money you need money to do what you wanna do
Like money is power honesty is power truth is power
But at the same time they tell you like

Ain't nothin' more important than the mula
You ain't really eatin' boy you gotta get your food up
We so steady eatin' baby you already know that
The way I'm droppin' new shit I'm sittin' on the toilet
Every night I tour that moment
But we don't take pictures when you're rich you just see it again
The only thing they really worry about is me and the pen
Wrote some shit on Instagram I'm just bein' honest
They tried to give your boy pills like I'm bein' violent
They tried to give your boy pills just to keep him silent
Keep tellin' people the truth you could be iconic
Try to stay inside I don't really like appearances
I try to stay inside but they still got something to say
It's deeper than that
Calico inside the handbag I'm keepin' the cat
I got some niggas in reserve like I'm deep in Iraq
And I'm deepening rap and it's deeper than rap
This is deeper than rap

Yo let the beat play until the cake part comes in
I like that part I like that part a lot
Cash rules everything around me
Yeah I like this
Black and white yo that's a zebra cake
Pancakes wedding cakes
That's all I wanted
Rainbows sunshine everywhere we go

I thought I told you 'bout it 
You don't leave home without it 
She on my back about it 

How could you ever question They know better to mention
The Budget truck ain't just enough to make her pay attention
The who what why and where they sport the flyest pairs
She got the nicest hair and she know life is better with this nigga
It's crazy how the world look different
It's crazy how the girls look different
The colors and the sounds so vivid
You never catch your boy pimpin'
Me sittin' on the sidewalk now that don't sound right
But as long as I look fly by prom night

He slangs his yay through the corridors
Every day twenty grands yep at the very least for sure
And they say there's no way
I should stay with someone like you but I tell them no
There's no way I could stray
Gotta stay with someone like you
'Cause I know one day
You could take me away far away
I know you could pay
All the money you made there'll be plenty of sunshine

When the world was discerned with this and that
I was young didn't know to hold it back
Now we here and the world is something else
We could leave any day you call for help
We were gods nobody was above me
That A on my chest like adultery
That A on my chest put your fist up
That A on my chest like a chipmunk
Breathe in breathe out nevermind
It was time number nine lies
Feline with a deathwish
No name on the guest list
Hold on we were destined

See now I don't wanna see an era 
See now I just wanna live forever and ever
Maybe it's the last night 

Yeah break free from all of the insides
They godless denied us
But we don't give a about the next day
We were never here never know if the world change
Common sense the consequences
Retweet the truth then regret the mentions
We are the wireless survivors of things gone
Slaves to the unnamed never live long
Live and die by the line never know fear
Even I won't survive is it unfair 
Is it unfair 'Cause I don't care
When I step on that ant on the grass
Progress the only thing that will last
Only God will survive
To be alone is alive

See now I don't wanna see an era 
See now I just wanna live forever and ever
Maybe it's the last night 

She got that body oh me oh my

Who the fuck Gambino this nigga on your TiVo 
My hotel cost a kilo banking like a free throw
Fuck y'all we A-Team y'all plan B like Walgreens
Cop that shit and paint it black niggas want they summer back 
Beans in my hand girl in the car
She still with her man but she seeing me tomorrow
Homegirl on that Master P watch us ball like referees
Unnecessary roughness We just trying to function
Used to sport them Filas 'cause my cousin pack them heaters
We don't wife 'em like Khalifa we just party then we leave 'em
Tell 'em that we hittin' we don't really see 'em
My girl look best when she only wear a fitted

Four thou' on my fit that's unnecessary
Skiing in Japan that's unnecessary
Molly on my rider that's unnecessary
'Bino spit the fire that ain't even necessary
That's unnecessary that's unnecessary
Roll out on a plane that's unnecessary
'Tussin and champagne nigga that ain't even necessary

They said don't buy the belt and I got it
They said don't get the Rollie and I bought it
Nigga I'm balling
My fucking mixtape can get you through college
Getting them dollars
Showing my pearly white teeth I'm a nigga that's flawless
Came a long way from dumping out Impalas
Same gun and pants different ski mask from coppers
All of this copper
Knock knock who could it be Niggas know I got it on lock
Yawk yawk bitch rappers better move before them niggas get dropped
Mr. Flop boy you got your label hot
I'm the hardest out you's a table cloth
Unnecessary balling I was carted off
Been fucking with my side bitch so much my main bitch can't stand it
Hunned racks in three months man this shit is outstanding
Seen a dollar go to stupid racks billion trillion
Nigga that's what I call building

Pushing in that bulletproof that's unnecessary
Stunting in the mall that's unnecessary
Condo on my arm that ain't even necessary
That's unnecessary that's unnecessary
Ibiza for a day that's unnecessary
Shows a hundred grands nigga that ain't even necessary

I did a song about Eminem
Soulja Boy did one right after
3 eyes these guys ain't seeing me
I'm the devil with angel wings
Pilot Talk currency
Stole the show burglary
I love that flow but I got more
Open condoms in condos
Open bottles of Moet
White with white girls in Eugene
We used to call hoes on three-way
And take 'em out to the movies
And now we just do it our way
She driving stick in the driveway
Just popped a molly with Miley
She do shrooms every blue moon
Hundred million trillion muthafuckin' racks nigga
Pinot grigio the lean'll go in that nigga
Now that's unnecessary
Been a legend since elementary
Ayo Bino tell these niggas I ain't no joke
She don't need speak she ain't giving no throat
You are under my control
Suspend the L's but I'm on a roll
Grade A honor roll
Mayday Soul 
What the fuck do y'all niggas really want 
I went with realness instead
But all the real niggas I know either crazy or dead
Yeah I dropped the free EP for these other kids to feel a lot
Niggas keep asking on whether this dude's for real or not
I'm not trying to come hard I'm trying to come me
That's why these older songs that I used to make I'd release free
What's the point of rap if you can't be yourself huh 
That's why I come first like my cell phone
I'm a role model I am not these other guys
I rap about my dick and talk about what girls is fly
I know it's dumb that's the fucking reason I'm doing it
So why does everyone have a problem with talking stupid shit 
'Cause sometimes that stupid shit is real shit
Like when you make out with your best friend's baby sis
You know the one with short hair you used to babysit 
 
You with a different girl like each and every fucking night
And kiss her while she's sleeping and sneak out the front to catch a flight
That's not life dude
It's just making up for fucks I missed in high school
I keep it wrapped until I meet the right one
'Cause I ain't Mumford I ain't tryin' to have sons
All I wanted was some more like Ashton
I ain't the coolest but I know I got passion

I really wanna do her right and it doesn't matter
We've got all the shine we need to find

Am I serious I don't even know
Are you hearing this This shit is laughable
I ain't trying I'm doing these other rappers are foolish
Is there room in the game for a lame who rhymes
Who wears short shorts and makes jokes sometimes 
So I guess we gon' see
I ain't Curren$y but if there ain't money in my name please murder me
Sometimes I feel like I ain't supposed to be here
Sometimes I wake up I don't want to be here
My mom loved to text me Psalm verses
She don't look at me like I'm the same person
I used to be the sweet one but things change
And I don't want her missing a son like Bon's last name
And all my uncles alcoholics shame on me
I drink whiskey till I'm grounded no TV
I wanna go inside the club with no gold piece
And walk in with no I.D. and No I.D
No matter how far the hood seems
We all still got hood dreams
I always wanted to get picked on the cool team
But alone is exactly how I should be

I've been grindin' my whole life nigga

Stuntin' on the low so they feel better
Damn why they hatin' on a real nigga 
East side Atlanta where they kill niggas
I was in a coma but I stayed with you
I'll be right by your side radio play me that new Smith Wesson
Bino won't die illest rapper alive
See what's up with Fredo when I'm out in the Chi
Murder everything I touch but I don't know why
And he can get the business your girlfriend love me
Turn it up who is this Shots at your fitted
Are we not young God is this not black excellence
I could lie to you people but my soul too sensitive
Threat to the throne man I'ma murder this
You are such a poser you ain't ever heard of this
Shots at you fake boys walkin' 'round in turtlenecks
And the hair so homeless record labels want us
Bino well read like Octobers
Hit me on my Snapchat hit me on my Nextel Chirp
Run up on them boys get murked
Nigga sit down he can't stand me
Curly black hair bright pink panties
Blush on the vanity tanner with her ass out
We don't have to love each other she just wanna cash out
Stone Mountain bitch run it off a mixtape
This is for my niggas up in Onyx getting shitfaced
He just dropped a mixtape she got so excited
Took her to a Clippers game and niggas ain't invited
Drugs on the rider need to clean my act up
Man I thought he was an actor
Thought he was a fuckin' joke when I wrote them fuckin' notes
Everything I do is dope I hope you niggas overdose
I hope you niggas hear the truth so honest in my interviews
Royalty I run the crew we them boys

Yo I've been grindin' my whole life nigga
Nah I'm talkin' 'bout 
I'm just sayin' I'm grindin' my whole life nigga
Nah know I'm talkin' 'bout 
Yo I got some more I got some more yeah yeah
Let me see Imma try and go in uh uhm

Mothafuckin' right we the niggas huffin' OG
In the club tryna keep it lowkey
She was all on my D then we fell out of it
'Cause I'm never really there and she tired of it
Real nigga shit real love real pain real intimate
These niggas so scared I'm killin' it
So serious gave the wrong young niggas money
They gave the wrong young niggas money
Gave the wrong young niggas money
Schoolin' these niggas got so many zeros they think I'm a dummy
Unlike these other niggas man I'm really from Atlanta
This dark-skinned art student with light-skinned advantage
I'm ahead of my time online messiah
Who spits so much fire that you a God damned liar
If you say he ain't hot numbers don't lie
Niggas do though when they say he ain't cold
Niggas need to learn code man I'm sick with the Python
Mothafucka I'm ill born just to die that's the human curse
The world in my words spit a universe
I know they hate a nigga down in Spin Mag
Worst album best song how you spin that 
The best part is that they love Chance
But our fans are the same you should fuck with your man
And I wonder what they'd say if that EP drop
His verse was wack his verse was hot
I'm on my jock 'cause I don't need these hoes
They're all the same so I don't need these clothes
Same white shirt with his nappy ass hair
bitch do I look like I care
Nah in the end they will notice that we've been God
I watched these niggas switch jerseys when your team lost
And yet it's bitch move nigga make the show 6 figures
Then you fly to Kauai for a week off
And his girl's body lookin' like a centaur
They do what they can I do what I want
Let's move it along the point of this song
I think you doin' fine all the time drop a fuckin' bomb nigga Vietnam
On my mom with my hand to God
So my hand's on my fuckin' chest but you didn't notice
Niggas hang around like we didn't notice
Niggas can't help me but they want a selfie
'Cause their girl is a fan and they really love us 
Know behind closed doors
You fuck with the kid or you still not sure Be a man about it
Don't talk your shit and shake hands about it
Be a man I doubt it I don't know

I've been grindin' my life

Why I'm looking so fly I'm just being me
In my girl clutch
White girls so twelve never really searched
Smoke cars swear to god
She need a bigger purse
Royalty I'm the boss we ain't gotta work
Lay it out on the island
She Hawaiian wonder if she let me slide in
The OG making noise like a firetruck

I'mma show you how to do this
Didn't mean to make you nervous
The booty lookin' retro
You can be the moon to me
And I can be your spotlight 
And if you think I'm ballin'
You should have seen me last night last night
Down under surfin' on the Gold Coast
I'm looking for the truth in a blunt
And I ain't got a home
So baby if you feel like you wanna leave
I ain't afraid to drop a couple skymiles
The game ain't easy
We both deserve a little bit of timeout

One more time Yeah nigga it's me again
I'm still around I guess I win
You hear me in your sister's room like all the time
Gambino Girl forever on that bracelet that she bought online
'Cause I'm taking all your city like I'm Carmen San Diego
I'm smoking I'm on fire
I am blazin' don't get hurt
To my white dudes it's a concert
To my black nerds this is church
From that NEw-York University dorm to The Emory
Everyone hated me I'm more hip hop than you'll ever be
You lookin dumb as hell man for ever sleepin' on him
Your girl is not around she busy sleepin on him
Will he fail 
Now that's the wrong conversation
Terry Gross on the mic I'm the talk of the nation uh

Black rock like a fuckin' Breaking Bad episode
Somethin' for these black kids to call they own
So when you skatin' in your driveway you not alone
She stay down like that new coat that I bought her
And the fly Rihanna girls be drinkin' my coconut water
And I'm lookin' at her butt
Thats that a twenty on twenty hindsight
My shit be Jackson Jordan Bolton Keaton Tyson 5 Mikes
Donald Glover no relation
Always workin' no vacation
They couldn't feel me no vocation
Murder verses the only motive was motivation
Money equals freedom
I've wanted this since a three-year-old
I've seen it all like I'm John Mayer's penis hole
Bein' me that's something that's so unusual
I've seen the future and the future go

Why these other rappers do shit stupid
While they be sleepin' I be onto that new shit

Can't you hear me callin' out your name
Oh can't you hear me callin' out your name
It seems like they all want me to fail
But I'm not going back
Please tell me you don't want me to fail
'Cause I'm not going back

I could've been a tragedy
That's why these fake niggas who call me pussy are mad at me
'Cause they ain't have the smarts or the heart
Ain't you read the fucking book Things Fall Apart 
I was never gonna stay the same
All I ever really wanted was to change the game
Spent the year kicking ass and taking names
Try to tell it to your heart Taylor Dayne
Mama told me I was special when them test scores came in
Calling me the new Will Smith that's Jaden
Calling me a faggot when I'm rapping that's hating
I need to slow down what the fuck is y'all saying 
Step inside the party y'all niggas is mood killers
My lifestyle simple live easy and Bruce Willis
I'm the boss Michael Scott y'all bitches is just Phyllis
Set the world on fire y'all motherfuckers is chillin' what is this 
That's why these fuckin' MCs want their asses back
Don't you know that I'm a rapist Ask a track
Whiskey sippin' wanna drink the whole bottle
But these smart middle-class black kids need a role model
Fuckin' hate me that's what I'm used to
Suck a dick we the shit Metamucil
God damn man there's gotta be a better way
Than taking all these drugs so I can stay awake
Like I'm Jessie in this bitch I'm so excited
There's a party at the top you ain't invited
But it's lame and all the bitches is fake
You think about your old girl and how breaking up's a mistake
Black dudes assume I'm closeted or kinda gay
White people confused like girl on Glee and Gabourey
IAmDonald is a full-time job
These niggas want me to fail so they can write me off

It seems like they all want me to fail
But I'm not going back

Dirty girls love my dick they're cockroaches
Jewish girls eat my meat it's not kosher
Relax black chick I think that I have offended thee
Got nothing against the sisters I just don't think they're into me
I am not a thug even if it's what they pretend to be
I am just myself so let's say my worst enemy
Yeah bitch cut the swag with a fucking knife
I come hard like my life keep her pussy tight
It's cool though it's all good
You want a dude who keep it real and stay hood
I'm sorry babe but I act me
I don't act Black whatever that be
I'm just happy these girls seem into me now
Yeah they're looking for some animal style
With this lettuce cheese bread-making sandwiches
That's why you niggas fail like all of your parents' marriages
Ran into Rashida Jones told me that she heard my song
When I called her mixed like the crowd at my last show
She said to write her something nice on the next track
But she cute so I wrote her ass a whole rap
Man I threw that shit away it felt dumb
Believe me it was bad we're better off you're welcome
I worked hard on that song like day and night
That whole song made this one verse crazy right 
I guess it all goes somewhere you know that 
Like that bullshit you talked before Culdesac
Couldn't see me as Spider-Man but now I'm spittin' venom
Now you payin' attention pick your fucking face up
When I wanna be a superhero I just wake up
Renaissance man with a Hollywood buzz
I refuse to go back to not liking who I was because

Fake love these fake dreams
These fake sounds
All the things that we felt
Your voice was screaming too loud
I know what you're ready to be
But it isn't with me
So I'm ready to leave you alone
I don't really wanna fight like this
I don't ever wanna lose your kiss
All I ever wanted was someone to hold onto
I just wanna be your girl
Everything you haven't heard
Plus I just wanna be with you
Extra bright I want y'all to see this
Turn on the lights in here baby
Know what I mean want you to see everything

Hollering at this Japanese girl Asian mommy
But is it too soon for Japanese girls Too tsunami 
Is it racist if I say she tastes like edamame 
Was I supposed to stay uncool Please remind me
 
Yeah it's Cheezy ho
I'm so cheesy ho my swag's got high cholesterol
I know y'all girls I met them all
You're her ex-man like Cannonball
I ain't got shit to say to ya I'm known for bad behavior
Man I went to the W from Double Tree
Makin' out with girls who black and yellow like a bumblebee
Can I live up to all this hype they have for me It's hard to tell
But these girls I'm kissin' chase the blues away like Gargamel
I'm back in the game coach put me in
T-Pain flow all I do is win
With a glass full of Macallan to mess me up
And the cash we can throw at them unless we fuck
After this I hit the highway
I'm headin' west like I'm fuckin' blowin' Kanye
Read the fuckin' news Huey Lewis nigga
Donald Glover you don't have to call me Childish
Except for when I'm flirting with your half-Latino stylist
Photoshoot beach house playin' Beach House free wireless
So I can post these pictures on my website of her smilin'
I kissed this girl I've liked since back when I was just a sophomore
What the fuck has changed Is it swagger Is it money 
I still dress the fuckin' same and my nose is still as ugly
As the day you fuckin' met me
They tellin' me I'm the rapper for these white kids
'Cause black kids can't possibly like the same shit
I wanna bring you back to the studio try and get your number
These black girls with natural hair who keep up with their tumblrs
I like it when you tweet me you smell like baby lotion
I wanna suck your breasts and finger blast to Frank Ocean
Her pussy tastes like vanilla tasty ho
Clown niggas then I kill 'em Gacy flow
It's crazy how these labels and these blogs are on my dick
I'm Pryor in his last years comedian who's sick
Fuck but I am sick seriously I don't feel so good
'Cause I don't get sleep and I'm always travelin'
And I don't go home and my friends don't call
'Cause I turned off my phone
I've made mistakes I bumped my head
Inside of this girl inside of my bed
Whatever man I'm just havin' fun
I'm sorry that I fucked her but now you know that she's not the one
I'm doin' you a favor like every time I rhyme or write a script or do a movie
There's a million ways to shine choose one
Instead of what you're doing tonight

Turn on the lights in here baby
Extra bright I want y'all to see this
Turn on the lights in here baby
Know what I mean want you to see everything
Now when they see us on the streets
All they wanna do is take pics

Skateboardin' down at Washington Square
Lookin' for quarters
Maybe afford a falafel for dinner ugh
I'm so broke man scholarship apologin'
Facebook messages from college kids who hollerin'
Girls say we love you we go to your show
You gotta do a show so we can come and molest you
This rap stuff is magic
I used to get called Oreo and Faggot
I used to get more laughs when I got laughed at
Oh you got a mixtape That's fantastic
But everybody thought it was jokes though
They half right the joke is
I got flow so don't act like
You ain't sittin' there with your friends like it can't be
I know Donald Glover he weak man he campy
I'm still knocked down but I up the ante
Me and hip-hop that black Sid and Nancy let 'em know

It's hard to make Hov the footsteps you followin'
Especially when your niggas look like Carlton
The pretty girls usin' skin so soft
Only be likin' black dudes with their hats broke off
Nigga you act too soft
Fuck you I'm from the projects
My mom was just workin' to give me options
No live shows 'cause I can't find sponsors
For the only black kid at a Sufjan concert
Yeah so whatcha gonna do man 
You won't speak to the hood man
If I was given one chance I think I could man
These black kids want somethin' new I swear it
Somethin' they wanna say but couldn't 'cause they embarrassed
All I do is make the stuff I would've liked
Reference things I wanna watch reference girls I wanna bite
Now I'm firefly like a burning kite
And you's a fake fuck like a fleshlight
Even dudes who like me straight lookin' at me crazy
Like how the hell he drop a EP and meet Jay-Z 
Girls used to tell me I ain't cool enough
Now text me pics sayin' You could tear this up
I don't really like shades big rims or jewelry
But gettin' time of day from a model is new to me
Bein' me isn't as hard as it used to be
Now everyone sing the chorus man you do it so beautifully

I guess I'm fucking now
I'm getting used to it
It's 'cause I shine and I ain't gotta use a crucifix
Fuck the fussing and fighting and arguing to this and that
I never text her back
I know it's comin' quick wishin' I could fast forward
Tell these nice girls they're the reason that I'm an asshole
Omega to alpha male because of that dollar bill
When I worked the mail room I ain't have a shot in hell
I called her ass for two months and heard shit from her
These girls couldn't care less when the chips under
The chips are up and on my shoulder you heard me 
I take it out on girls who don't even deserve it
The girls I tried to hit last year I still might
Karma's a bitch who doesn't suck but I still like
If we were kids I had the black K-swiss and reebok
If we were kids I wouldn't act like this but we not

You made a mistake
These dudes man you bathing in apes
Finding you is like finding Asians I hate
But they say I got a fetish nah I'm skipping all of it
Black or white girls always come with a set of politics
That's all I was saying
I'm a proud man
They wanna holla when they see your name on SoundScan
Her name Mercedes but she push a brown Focus
And she's doing coke in front of me but act like I don't notice
She see what she wanna see
So I make her take Plan B in front of me
Women talk shit on men like all day
But it's Pete Wentz goes both ways
They too busy stabbing hoes like OJ
They too busy trapping pros like Kobe
The only thing I put before me is do re
If you had told me the truth we'd be ok

Childish Gambino got that swagger
All these pussy niggas 'round here don't matter
All that I know is that I wanna dance with ya
Move in closer before I'm gonna kiss ya
Know that you know me don't act stupid
You seem different tired of these groupies
I'm on fire won't find figga
Got big shots saying That's that nigga
Hovy with glasses Weezy but geeky
Girls in the lobby tryin' to meet me
I ain't afraid to say it yeah I love these hoes
And their glasses and their jacket and their hipster clothes
Yes I'm always on tour what you mad at that for 
Slamming that thing like a Cadillac door
I love fast women Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Have your cake and eat it baby it's your birthday

Mama you are with the right man Juno
Tell me what you wanna do I will make it happen
Yes I'm drinking whiskey baby I am gone tonight
NBC is not the only thing I'm coming on tonight
Gross why the fuck I say these things 
It isn't over haven't heard the chubby lady sing
Everybody love me call a nigga Raymond
These weak niggas always in your face like Raybans
Yes I bring the heat girl fire for fireman
Baby I'm your hero Donald for Spiderman
I'm in love with you but this is not tennis
And baby stay stacked like she bad at Tetris
Rude boy I Rihanna that vagina
Tell your boy good luck tryin' to find ya find ya

Words that I made up you say my name like
Picking out my fro with my fist comb
I got a tab at the Stone baby this long
My little brother was having a little trouble
I hope that he doesn't care that it's in this song
Koreatown lunchin' talking 'bout how to run things
He said Atlanta wanted something
Waka Jeezy and Future got the streets locked down
Copycats making sure Tip keep that crown
I'm fucking 'round with the truth went to see The Roots
Quest brought me back on stage in a suit
I went hard 'cause niggas say that I'm soft
Even Black thought I maimed it a little hard I gotta be honest
Feeling like the other stuff is kinda behind us
Making jokes here and there done got us some dollars
I'm tryna show the whole world what it is and it ain't a game
He said homie stay the course ain't shit changed
Weird night and everybody was tipsy
Hanging out with Questlove reminiscing 'bout Whitney
That reminds me I sent a long text message to my mom and pop
I got the same speech when I left thirty Rock
Shout out to my nigga Lud shout out to my nigga Swank
For hanging at the crib and telling me what you think
Speak from your heart and never compromise what you feel is real
And never let these white people tell you how to feel
Never let anybody tell you how to feel
I wanted what they had back in the fourth grade
Family vacas you know I did it all
Just to see my little sis by a waterfall
My great granddad bought his own freedom
Walk barefoot to Virginia to start his own peanut farm
So don't be alarmed man I'm royalty
More swag pull back on the punchlines
Starving every track means lunch time
I'm a star how could I not shine 
Fuck boys chase hype and scrat chicks
DG Lover ain't nothing to fuck with
Dick-money ain't nothing to fuck with
And what's a leader if he isn't reluctant
Too bad for y'all I'm blasting off
I'm not Asher Roth I don't sleep on my bread
Dick riders stay close I might flash a ball
Sometimes all this shit make a nigga feel guilty
I used to sleep with them roaches
Back of my mind though I hope the show gets cancelled
Maybe then I can focus
Hawaii touch down go ahead baby put your shades on
East Side East Side to the gravestone 
Brown liquor but my girl in Bed-Stuy
Nigga you got Drive like a sale at Best Buy
Hold up hold up we can do better
Put my voice on the track man that shit is much wetter
At the studio at eight
Hit the booth then eat nigga we ain't them nigga we ain't them 
Drop a line it's your Facebook status
Said that shit about a week ago you still mad at us
If there's something on your chest nigga let it out
Whenever you need my hand
I'll hold you down oh

It's what they used to yell back in seventh grade
My momma said she'd get me that new jacket
When the cost go down
Hit the office stole some Tommy Hill from lost and found
Not bad for a family of foster child
Lookin' fly man I'm flossin' now
But them niggas saw through me
Are you serious What is this
Took the jacket off third period ellipsis
Listening to Sky Is the Limit on my Walkman
Thinking if Biggie can make it through it man then I can
Dope-boy swag I always wanted that
But my persona was always more of that Arthur Ashe
But no love for the son of a commuter who was a radio head
And okay at them computers at the post office
It's funny how you smoke niggas then you start coffins
All my people need throat lozenge
My fear is dead ambition drove the hearse
But niggas got me feelin' I ain't black enough to go to church
Culture shock at barber shops 'cause I ain't hood enough
We all look the same to the cops ain't that good enough 
The black experience is black and serious
'Cause being black my experience is no one hearin' us
White kids get to wear whatever hat they want
When it comes to black kids one size fits all

The reason that they say I'm nothin' what they seen or heard's
The same reason Will Smith always opposite Latino girls
They only see you how they wanna see you
'Til you make them see you in some other way I'm trippin' off the other day
'Cause God knows what these white kids say and do
You're not not racist 'cause The Wire's in your Netflix queue
Subtle racism it's hard to pin it
'Cause you'd only understand if you were me for just a minute
This one kid said somethin' that was really bad
He said I wasn't really black because I had a dad
I think that's kinda sad
Mostly 'cause a lot of black kids think they should agree with that
If you're a father you should stick around if you could 'cause even if you're bad at it you could Tiger Woods
We warriors we all need senseis
Change everything that we've done so far
I mean just the way that we see each other
I won't stop until they say James Franco is the white Donald Glover
Yeah these niggas wanted Cookie but instead I gave 'em Loch Ness
Sick Boi for life my swag is in a hospice
Aimin' for the throne Jay and Ye said to watch that
They ask me what I'm doin' and I said I'm stealin' rock back

First off let me say I'm drunk off of shitty wine
So I'll probably use the B word a couple times
I used to love your fucking mouth you had enough of mine
But what's the reason for you never gave me any sign
When we were making out you kind of act like it was nothing
Like you were doing it to prove you could do it or something
You know I'm fine with getting fucked by girls who are my friends
You fucked me in a different way I guess it all depends
Texting on my day off 
Hey babe what's going on
It's funny how I see you with these bad boys you hanging on
I told ya I'm a soldier need a girl scout to tag-a-long
Face down ass up that's the way you left me
I thought there was a spark but we were missing Lisa Leslie
You know it's fucking childish to write a song to get me
I'm always fucking childish you knew that when you met me

You ain't that fine bitch what the fuck you heard 
I love these shitty ass chicks I guess I'll never learn
I hate it when you think you really getting something good
And you don't listen to your dudes when you really should
I got so many fucking girls I can't even count 'em
There's probably six or seven girls who think this song's about them
Never kiss in public but at home I am affectionate
Fucking bitches left and right my dick is ambidextrous
I know you probably texting this lyric to your friends
Saying This nigga think he all that He fucking sucked in bed
I think we both know that I worked that ass
I hope your dude can keep it stretched yoga class
I'm trying hard not to use a specific reference
But you'll probably know that it's you after the first sentence
So let me quit while I'm ahead like a penis tip
If I never was in love with you I hope you know I'm meaning it

3 a.m. stare at the ceiling murder the feeling
Spider crawl in the corner brown recluse
So appropriate cornucopia so be it say I'm over it
Look at my feet I put my sneakers in the trunk
Pass a Fatburger through Atwater village
Laugh for a minute couldn't cry for the life of me
Park by the bridge sit on the hood
Look at the cars stare at my hands look at the moon
I can't find it it's gone what's wrong 
Didn't respond when I texted you last night
Don't go gotta know please don't run away
I'm a murderer what does that change 

Man is a star bound to a body inside of me
Twenty million degrees burn a man to his knees
Late at night in a hurry bought a McFlurry
And half of an apple pie when I'm laughing I'm satisfied
When I'm dying I'm still alive strange position
I'm in a good mood so good I'mma kill that spider
In spite of the kinda things that they told me
Alone don't mean that you lonely
Alone means you finally get it admit it
Go home lock up the door fold up the clothes
Watch cartoons for an hour turn off the lights
Look at the recluse look at the recluse

'Bino will you be my baby daddy yup
I'm too fresh man the world ain't never had me yup
I'm too fresh man y'all ain't never gave me that
Stone Mountain ain't no doubting and these niggas won't hold me back
They wasn't hating him anyway
My roommate exercise man he moving that heavyweight
My girl ain't down to ride couldn't deal with my day to day
I'm at my Grandma's house man like I don't know what to say
Maybe I'm sorry but sorry don't pay the rent
I promise to pay you back and I don't know where he at
But tell him he missing out his grandson is cool as fuck
And tell me who be standing when them other ones giving up 
Let's keep it spontaneous I don't need that rehearsal
More flow man than Progressive commercials
Get with the program 'cause the plus loan ain't putting us on
I got month long before I take the bus home

I know this music shit ain't shit
And all these random niggas in my house make you anxious
And I ain't never told you that our love would be painless
But I was so in love with you I thought we could make it
Damn I wasn't in it damn we wasn't finished
Damn I got us tickets damn we went to Venice
Prioritize on our lives and made you into a business
That's why you wasn't surprised when I had made my decision
Gotta make it 'cause if not I'm a failure my wallet Azalea
And my brother still moving ain't no shit I can tell him
Trying to keep him out of trouble but the cops is wilding
It's nice to have a felon when the boys get violent
The Mexicans tried to jump me at the club
Funny thing was I thought they were stepping to show me love
Grandma's couch my biggest fear and fantasy
When I ain't in her arms all I'm making is enemies
Here I'm screaming obscenities at a nigga
Wanted to live bigger than me
Them Edenwald projects was eatin' our concept
Of anyone walking out what is you talking about 
Gun Hill Road made them summers feel cold
On the same train that my parents met on
Twenty years later and my thoughts still ghetto
High off of pressure man that's a stiletto
Got your own couch now but you don't feel better

'Cause if not I'm a failure
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever
Pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your shit bare
See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's
Bringing me out the dark
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep
Me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all
You had my heart inside of your hands
We could have had it all
You had my heart inside of your hands

Baby I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling we could've had it

Swag
You think that I keep fucking other girls you know I'm not
Come back to me like hipsters to Blogspot
Let me kiss you on your neck and make your heart stop
I'll give your new dude a fat lip Pharcyde
I wrote another song I'm not where I belong
My eyes water when I see hers catalogue
I never thought you were a cheater that was all
I need to get ahold of my head jacking off
You ran back to them grody-ass indie dudes
James Perse cardigans scuffed-up tennis shoes
Wow girl that's what you really wanted huh 
A Michael Cera knockoff I guess I wasn't white enough
You said I wasn't capable of loving you I never was
A twenty-something nigga touring the world with hella buzz
I'm saying that my life's swell cortizone
Fuck Macaulay Culkin never going home alone
iPhone photos show 'em just to mock you
Read your Twitter messages too proud to block you
You know that his glasses fake
That's why I'm dating girls now whose asses ain't
Damn Donald why you gotta be so mean
I'm a nice guy that's why you broke up with me
You probably in the club dancing to this right now
Play it cool text me when you walk out
It's just childish
I know it's your first
I will try to be gentle

Worst rapper to ever spit on an open mic
Worst rapper to ever get on so many likes
Worst rapper to ever blow up and over night
Young black and gifted but he still in America
Heard the flow was getting better is he sleeping with Erykah 
They passing me they demos these rappers I think it's funny
'Cause they tryna get my demo young white kids with money
I promise worst rapper iTunes most played
It's just me and both Macs self made self paid
Headlines saying he leaving to be a rapper
I drive until it's dirty please somebody call the Brinks truck
That OG I might so Avengers keep it lowkey
Well I'm sitting on top of the world
There's only one second secure
But I can't get it back
My life is a sham no time to react breathe
Find solace in the fact my ball bigger
Pause like dog fingers
Give a fuck 'bout y'all niggas
Get the point like ball kickers
I do shit eat good need a toothpick
Your girl play my music
So that's thumbs down to your new shit

Buddha stance in a forest on the ayahuasca
I'm as high as copters binoculars
Looking down on my confidence
Truly honest man I wish there was more of us freaking out
I wet the bed the first night on my tour bus
God damn what're you doing man 
I can't name a lot of rappers that you better than
He hates women and himself I won't give him the chance
Tear myself down first to make 'em pay in advance
Heard a lot of y'all talking behind his back
When he walking out
Me and Fam in the corner what are they talking 'bout 
The same dudes who laughing after you go
Be the same dudes emailing asking you 'bout your show
Me and my homies making flicks
Me and my homies making beats
Me and my homies making hits
Me and my homies hit the spot roll with us gold diggers
I don't really like those niggas Childish like goldfishes
We saw this kid get shot up by the cops in Atlanta
They shot through his Phantom
And tandem cannons were blamming him
He was standing there like twenty seconds before
Now he gasping for air bullet holes inside of his dome
What's the point I don't know
Why am I here Why am I alive Why do you care 
Living real everyday what was your undoing 
Khalifa's first name now there's urine on him 
Damn 'Bino why you gotta do it to em 
New shit new shit alert never fake 
There's levels to the shit like a wedding cake

My new girls so pretty that the world shine
My new girls getting kissed by the coast line
My new girl so pretty we can bovine
Worst rapper ever how I'm giving out a cosign 
Chance The Rapper yeah that nigga crazy
Big brother little brother lifestyle wavy
I don't wanna be alone

'Cause ya know somewhere inside I cannot find
The feeling I got from you
No somewhere inside I cannot find
The feeling I got from you oh

Hard for a Pitchfork soft for a Roc-a-Fella
Music was my side chick but now we're moving in together
Always felt misunderstood I guess I have to tolerate
My swag Jehovah Witness dude it never take a holiday
Jeans brown leather jacket on
Thick Filipino chick homemade bracelet
Her booty make her just a rapper she ain't gotta say shit
I'm someone they admire
Set the game ablaze I'm an arcade fire
Laughed at my rise like my motion was funny
Yes ashy to classy my lotion is money
The ride is easy when the dollar's there to grease the wheels
Now everybody tell me what to do and how to feel
It seems the more I try to connect with the world
I am feeling more alone than I ever have felt before
I wanna pick up the phone ask my dad how to handle it
But what will happen when my dad's not there to answer it 
I try to clear my mind of thoughts that only slow me down
Like when these niggas called me faggot and we homies now
But we are not homies I just keep you around
'Cause all your talkin' is the noise I need to kill the sound
Of all these voices tellin' me no one can help me out
We are alone I'm just the only one to figure out

You are the bestest I will obey you
These words I wrote for you when you were fuckin' other dudes
The only thing I need from you now is some solitude
Actions over words girls will be girls that's all it proves
I used to be this guy sittin' with an open heart
Now my computer screen's the only place I feel a spark
I don't fuck with fake bitches
Except for when I fuck with fake bitches
Of these girls who wouldn't talk to me a year ago
Chick askin' for money she get zero though
Here I go again talkin' money women and clothes and cars right 
You could switch all of my words out with Plies' right 
People sayin' we're the same please come from under me
We are just some rappers got no luxury of subtlety
No subjects when we're rappin' we say it like we hear it
I put it on a track and I hope you get the spirit 'cause

I don't wanna be alone 'Cause ya know somewhere inside I cannot find
The feeling I got from you
No somewhere inside I cannot find
The feeling I got from you
Y'all better watch out
'Cause big trouble's on the mic now
I knock all of your lights out
With my verse y'all be cursed explodin' like some fireworks

You step to me and you're gonna get creamed
Corn all up in your teeth you reek
You're the opposite of chic ya freak
Your rhymes are like antiques nobody wants 'em
They throw 'em all away
Rhymin' from the get go like your brain is on delay
Matter of fact yo you better get a checkup
Go ask your doctor why you be so ugly from the neck up 

A hug can be the most wonderful thing
Two arms wrapped around you like a mother's wing
But we're so selfish when we are blue
Doesn't a hug deserve a hug too 

Yeah  Crew's comin' at ya
Say it twice don't forget it y'all better catch up
To where we're at
You're behind the times can't compete with our dope rhymes
So you better say your goodbyes
We got Francois Blitz Comet the Jersey kid on the beats
You know we rocks it Demolition the dopest girl on the mic
And Alpha Dog I bark the truth my verses be all nice and tight
The crew shines brighter than a Quasar
But you're bizarre
Yes you sir are a loser
So cover up that freakish dome and head back home and take your poems

Hey Mordecry or I mean Mordecai
Didn't mean to diss you please don't run away and hide
Saw you sobbin' at that movie A Very Happy Bride
Here I'll pass you a tissue try and have some male pride
'Cause the ladies don't like your sensitive side
Like Margaret for example but I guess that's implied
She won't get with you she just won't get with you
Not gonna get with you Never gonna get with you

What is this place this magical field
It's wide and it's open nothing's concealed
It's scenic and peaceful for us to enjoy
Why this is the park Good show old boy 
A place of great beauty for plenty to use
It inspires us all so go spread the news
To man woman child or begging cowboy
This is the park Good show old boy 
The key to this place puts a smile on your face
It is the people that it does employ
Why this is the park Good show old boy 

Mordecai Rigby
Friends don't let down other friends
You guys are losers

Your attitude is unappealing some would say quite rude
Your shoes are colorful

Come on tough guy why are you tongue-tied
Watch out everybody looks like grandpa's 'bout to cry

Weathering a righteous storm the rainiest of days
Friends stick together through thick and thin always
We're sorry Pops we were acting like fools
We hope you can forgive us for being complete tools
Your poems aren't lame they're really works of art
If we're gonna win this battle we gotta do it from the heart

Beauty is in the center of all that you see
Simple yet complex and fully textured
And beauty be a part of all that you be
For you are the best rhymers that I've ever heard 

Why you talkin' 'bout beauty man
Don't understand what that's got to do with you fool
You guys are like spoiled hams in a can
Super bland expiration date's overdue

The canning of meat is quite a sweet treat
So thanks for comparing us so
Your words are inspiring ideas so concrete
You really put on quite a show 

Okay hold up you wanna talk words and verbs 
But your face is distracting so ugly it bugs me
Take care of that mess and sweep it under the rug please
So trust me you're only taking matters from bad to worse
Only solution is to turn around and reverse

A gift to us new perspective on things
Life looking different from where you stand true
So much to discover so spread your wings
And take flight for a birds-eye view

Okay this be gettin' serious
You guys are delirious are you hearin' this 
Talkin' 'bout positive things but you ain't got no game
And it's plain to see your strange to me 'cause we be
Shining like diamonds y'all be petty cash
Nice mustache conquistadors be wanting it back
In fact what are you 
A rat a squirrel some kind of fat meerkat who thinks he's rad
And look at that your bird friend's dropping words absurd again
Useless bits of rhymes that expose the nerd in him
You think Alpha Dog is gonna lay down and let you win 
Head be all inflated I guess just like a giant blimp

It's been some time since I felt this way
Challenged by such worthy opponents
Your rhyme-scheme is good but you're missing a few components
You may say things that hurt or some that will sting
But for you it's all just posturing
Look inside and be true to some real feelings
And the world will be yours I'm assuring
So I thank you good sirs for this great contest
It's certainly been lots of fun
But there's nothing you can say to put me to rest
So really I've already won
Now that we have found this love baby
I can't explain my feel oh
Now that we have found this love baby
I've never felt this real oh
Loving you is all I know baby
You make me feel so high oh no
I just wanna feel your love baby
You know I'm down to ride

When your song is on and your hand's in mine
And I'm holding you tight make it feel good
Let me hold it down I'm so glad we found
It's whenever you like make it feel good

Now that we have found this love baby
These haters can't say shit oh
I know sometimes it's hard when I'm so far
Let's go somewhere far away baby
Where we don't need no phone oh
'Cause now that we have found this love baby

When your song is on and your hand's in mine
And I'm holding you tight make it feel good
Let me hold it down I'm so glad we found
It's whenever you like make it feel good

I used to walk on the beach at night
The best time was when well me and you
We got all our friends and we got a tent
We slept in it
Not the whole night but just enough time
Magic happened nothing was born luckily
It's up to me but
Then we left
The times have changed
The pleasures that I feel
They say you never say never it's real
Electric eels in the water we should probably not go deep
I like to stare at you and look at you when you sleep
I'd like to write a poem for you leave it for you in your room Under the moon romance
Hold on brother
I used to dream every night now I never dream at all
I'm hopin' that it's 'cause I'm livin' everything I want
I used to wake up in a bed between my mom and aunt
Playing with this Land Before Time toy from Pizza Hut
My dad works nights putting on a stone face
He's saving up so we can get our own place
In the projects man that sounds fancy to me
They called me fat nose my mom say You handsome to me
Mrs. Glover ma'am your son is so advanced
But he's acting up in class and keeps peeing in his pants
And I just wanna fit in but nobody was helping me out
They talking hood shit and I ain't know what that was about
'Cause hood shit and black shit is super different
So I'm talking hood shit and cool it now like New Edition
Mom and dad wouldn't listen
They left the Bronx so I wouldn't be that
All their friends in New-York deal crack
It's weird you think that they'd be proud of 'em
But when you leave the hood
They think that you look down on 'em
The truth is we still struggle on a different plane
Seven dollars an hour with vouchers it's all the same
Facebook messaging hopin' that could patch up shit

Yeah Dad lost his job mama worked at Mrs. Winner's
Gun pulled in her face she still made dinner
Workin' two jobs so I can get into that white school
And I hate it there
They all make fun of my clothes and wanna touch my hair
And my uncle on that stuff that got my grandma shook
Drug dealers roughed him up and stole his address book
He's supposed to pay 'em back
He owe 'em money but his bank account is zero
So my momma made us sleep with Phillips heads
Under the pillow like that would do somethin'
But she's got six kids she's gotta do somethin'
She don't want me in a lifestyle like my cousin
And he mad 'cause his father ain't around
He lookin' at me now like
Why you so fuckin lucky I had a father too
But he ain't around so I'mma take it out on you
We used to say I love you now we only think that shit
It feels weird that you're the person I took sink baths with
Street took you over I want my cousin back
The world sayin' what you are
Because you're young and black don't believe 'em
You're still that kid who kept the older boys
From teasin' for some reason

There's a world we can visit if we go outside

Can you hear me now 
Oh help us Lord
There's a bottom to the top of a moment
You won't always be around
Catch a nigga coming quickly behind you
People want you underground
Do you misbehave 
Haunt you to your grave
I'm going to eat you alive
Please don't find me rude
But I don't eat fast food
So don't run too fast

She make a movie with her friends
Put it up in a minute
Everybody say it now
Ain't no loop at the minute
Everybody saying
I'ma show you what it done
But enough for a finish
Pay attention you listen
You keep losing your mind
How you want to loop this shit
But looking like a Vine 

But they no pay for no privilege
Now she broke in Koreatown
In the condo you rented
Better get your percentage

She must've fucking lost her mind yeah
He want to move to California
He want to hang with DC Fly

All the people all around and the follower people
I go make a girlfriend giggle
Make her feel so official make it Serena Vista
Supernova new residual making money a little
Make the smoker illegal
Make the living illegal
Make the laughing illegal
Make it snap for a people
When you make a movie now
Know you making no difference
It's a tickle on the mind
'Fore me finish your sentence
So go pimp a like on Vine 

But don't pay for the privilege
Now you broke in Koreatown
In the condo you rented
Better get your percentage
Oh you broke in Koreatown
In that condo you rented
Better get your percentage

In California she must've fucking lost her mind yeah
He want to move to California
He want to hang with DC Fly
Small chick with a fat ass
Did I say that out loud Let me back track
I know my game ain't that bad
Have you ever made out with a Gap ad 
And girls want what they can't have
So I don't text back when the screen flash
You love me You mean cash
Need a friend you can fuck I can be that
Crush girls now couldn't last year
Oh you like me now Well that's weird
Last year you were chillin' with Lil Wayne
Now you wanna pretend like my feelings is still the same 
My work is my playtime
I need you to understand and to stay fine
Do this and I just might wife you
Let me poke you ma Raichu
Fuck your life
I don't really think I drank enough tonight
Looking at you make me wanna fuck for life
Lame ass dudes gon' suck tonight
But so are these girls am I wrong or right 
Girl do somethin' to me
Y'all girls have never been good for me
Watch a nigga take over mutiny
I wanna fuck with the lights on
Hey girl let a python slide on
Stay sick infect me Lysol
I'm on the edge they hoping that I might fall
I make it work I'm running with a new crew
And we do dope shit you ain't used to
For me by me fuck Fubu
This girl never heard of me go and check YouTube
I got a house with a dope view
But enough about high school
I'm getting laid or I'm getting lied to
You number one in The Pack Based God
Should I say something dumb to give us something to fight about 
Never mind lights out

I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it
Show me what you doing I don't wanna lose
Have them lights turned on show me what you doing
Show me what you do to me

Talking on Twitter see where to go next
She look like the Social Network chick
Except for her ass is twice as thick man
Just wanna bite that shit
Where the fuck did my license went 
I must've left it at the other place
I rent a loft downtown with a ton of space
Yeah we doing stupid shit have stories when I'm older
But I don't wanna see pictures of us on Vulture
Never thought about a year ago
I'm chillin' out with the friends at the Super Bowl
Things change like a motherfuck
That's why I wild out keep the city up
Uh I talk a lot about the girls in my songs
But you are different from the girls in my songs
Stop talking 'bout the girls in my songs
If you don't like it I can just take you home
More green than the top of these tree trunks
Leave your boyfriend here 'cause he bunk
By the way what's your name 'cause we drunk

I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it 
Show me what you doing I don't wanna lose 
Have them lights turned on show me what you doing 
I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it
Show me what you doing I don't wanna lose
Have them lights turned on show me what you doing

I want the lights turned on
Show me how you do it
 
Show me what you doing I don't wanna lose
 
Have them lights turned on show me what you doing
 
Show me what you do to me
 
One time I was at the beach
And we were looking at the stars
And this girl was laying next to me
And the blanket that we had was  had stars on it as well
So it looked liked we were just floating in an abyss
Honestly when I see her face I just smile I guess
I mean our cars came and the lights were on so we could see what the waves look like
I'll be waiting here on the sand
I remember that first night
You were wearing a power ranger black T-shirt
So was I a different color so was Moey and his brother
Not as pure so insecure
The times have changed
But really we just looked up at the stars
For a couple hours turned off all the lights on the cars
The world was ours it was yours and it was mine
The time flew by like it was prime time and I'm inside of
Life you shouldn't be my wife you should just be with me
On this beautiful night
Maybe we can make things right
Maybe we can do it without any spite
It's just for tonight and we hope it doesn't end
So we drive back to our homes chilling with our friends

Balling like Jabari Parker they say I look like him
If we met bet it would be awkward break out the Sudafed
'Cause the flow cold like a SoCo
This that call yo grandma you ain't ready yet
Verbal mania imma show you the illest get my cousin to kill it
Had a flow but you steal it I'm in the mood so we ball out
Got the top down in the back we could fall out
We could fall out nigga we could fall out
Your girlfriend push a Prius she giving me that genius
Mensa we that Tony Danza
Wine on the rug man you know that shit expensive
I'm on that Willy Wonka green so Blanka
Vape so good and the pot like lobster
Nigga imma monster fuck it I'm a monstar
Man I got this beat I'm going ham like a cop car
That's unless you see me pulling up on the boulevard
Turn them flashing lights at least you know who you really are
We are becoming god

I guess this ending's the best for me
But I can't leave you behind
You know that I never wanted to see what's on your mind

Yo it's kinda hard not to like get fucking cheesy on this shit
But does that even matter 
My nigga Jaden Smith dropping jewels and niggas don't believe him 'cause he's Jaden Smith
But it's all about packaging right 
Real shit though good and bad is all relative man
It really is a lot of niggas is sheep
We don't even know what we like anymore
We just know what the most hype is
Shit do you really like that shit you like 
Or you like the way they gave it to you 
Pepsi Coca-Cola same thing
Dave Chapelle said that the one that taste the best
Was the one that was paying him the most at the time
That's all that happens with us man
We some weak niggas man all of us
Followers sheeps plural made that shit up
Apologin' ain't no real word my nigga
We know this but he knows more 'cause he broke the rules that don't even fucking exist man
Funny thing is man is like as a futurist
And I can call myself a futurist
Nobody is even going to give a fuck until I'm gone
So does it even matter Yes it does

Investing time on writing lies slightly truth without a clue
I met my higher self pissing off the roofs of drunken goofs
He said keep the mic smelly like a rotten tooth
And all your fears forgotten when the Cap is in the booth
I'm an angel in an agony of flame
Feathers growing at the mention of my name reinvention of my shame
I'm a slave to the darkness of my innermost cave
And all these words I hold tighter than a glowstick at a rave nigga
Dance around the camp fire buttnaked blowing trees
Could give a single fuck if somebody sees I'm free
Red V bleed out a scarlet letter kill a king
And I'll sitting ready for whatever weather the seasons sing
Picking up expensive habits chasing after little rabbits
Hope they lead me to a place of magic
Sad at all the times I never thought I had it
Losing all these memories and y'all doubt it matters

Mouth to a Pellegrino bottle color of envy
Who the fuck is Gambino I hand a waitress a benji
To act like she never met me I'm saying though
They want the game changed when your shit on the radio
Fruit was so hanging low I didn't even bother
She tryna land Obama's man she get it from her mama
I don't blame her I tame her give her something to visualize
On my couch watching American Dad
Man those new Celine bags are so to die for
I'm in that Porsche on Prozac them suicide doors
Watch her walk as the death becomes her
'Cause Mrs. Tarantino kill bills no wonder
My heaven is the present so maybe this is it
Pray to God every night to make me believe he exists
Drink a fifth of vodka I don't need no sponsor 
Heard a preacher holler make him hold these souls

Little hands little feet
Tiny heart tiny beat
Oh thinkin' 'bout the time we spent falling in love together
I don't wanna leave you I don't wanna deceive you
But oh when mama cries from daddy's lies
Oh my please don't take him away mama
Don't take him away oh

'Cause I've had my time oh 
Don't take my baby boy
Don't take my pride and joy
I hope I stay close I hope I stay close

All the pain all the tears
Many nights many years
This love for me is fading
You waited but I never came home to you
I've never lied about us
We were never supposed to be together
When you see me with some other one
And they know your son
Oh please don't take him away
You say you won't but you will yes you will

'Cause I've had my time oh 
Don't take my baby boy
Don't take my pride and joy
I hope I stay close I hope I stay close

There was a time before you
And there will be a time after you
 
Though these bodies are not our own
Walk tall little one walk tall
Let me hold you let me hold you

Hangin' out with Kilo  Kish smokin' on that keisha
I'mma need that visa
I'm working on everything that I'm touching man
I'm bussin' two white Russians drinking themselves
But it's still ain't nothing yo
It's East side if you can't tell North Decatur and Glendale
So fuck you all if you don't like me  good
Put that on my partner man I wish a nigga would
I say we ain't playing man I hope that's understood
I'm in my zone though fucking round
Eating my mamas salmon but skipping on the risotto
Girl said that she need the follow tweet her and she'll do any
Man I'm trying to stay off readin' em makes me angry
On the back on the tour bus recording the two of us
Stacks at the Apple store man this ballin' is new to us
Trying to make amends bailing on all my friends
Niggas went to the club sent a beat to Gucci instead
Man I'm feelin' right my nigga Fam yelling don't stop
And half my crew is always faded on some lowtop
Stopped drinking for the most part
My only vices all our pictures on my laptop
Screaming at me saying I ain't what you really want
Christina's parents baby all I make is Milians
We got the shows we got the paper but I want respect
So tell them haters we ain't quitting yet

One love the thing that hasn't changed
My parents lost their job it's so cold in the A
Now that I'm one percent I send most of it home
I want to stunt but she need to pay off her student loans
And everybody saying Get it while you hitting man
Dude is so stupid popping anything they hand me
On that parking lot pimping and politicking in Miami
In that home of the D where they sell that cake batter
Heard a voice in the back hate from all the fake rappers
That I shitted on shitted on
Shitted on shitted on
Rap your soul dude let the mic blaze
Show 'em A-Town East Side all day
I put it on I put it on
Life is somethin' and love is at a climax
I ain't even started Was it stupid I departed 
Man probably but now we do the things we always wanted
I'm proud of me 'cause I am undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with
Please somebody cum laude me
Graduated anticipated the hatred and doubted me
Not a prodigy just a hard worker from the Dean's List
But most these rappers doin' so-so like a seamstress

Late ass nights come from long days
Doin' all the right things in the wrong ways
Doin' all the wrong shit for the right reasons
Sprinklin' midnight game call it night seasoning
Haters get salty give 'em cholesterol
Trill O.G mop up the floor with the best of y'all
Then dry that bitch off with the rest of y'all
And catch a flight to Rio de Janero for la festival
Yeah and that's word to fit a baldy
Ball hard like it's cement inside of my Spalding
And I'll break your face with a no look pass
Now back to your parking lot pimp with yo little hook ass
I use harsh words 'cause these are hard times
And trill-ass people nowadays they're such a hard find
So it's one eye open if I could peep 'em
And one on the scope so if they frontin' I can sleep 'em
Man my flow is so parabolic
The energy'll blow you over even if you're brolic
Goddamn it now that's one for the Googlers
That fell sleep on they desk and never step their noodle up
Takin' lames out never been new to us
The hardest part of this shit is figurin' which of you to bust

Rest in peace to them niggas who was dead wrong
Toni Braxton to them niggas that's a sad song
Cry a river Timberlake the whole industry
Record the whole album in my living room in Italy
Niggas who wasn't feelin' me secretly want a handout
Keep your mouth shut I can probably help your man out
Drop a new stack all lames get to steppin'
Drop a new track all blogs go to heaven
Kill the web man these niggas need they hits up
Kiss her neck add a dime to the tip cup
She is not a slut fuck a dude who says so
Just because she's fuckin' doesn't mean she ain't a lady
Kill the whole stage I never needed a mic check
Semen on my spacebar fuckin' tired of Skype sex
Runnin' with a new breed me and Bun B
This hip-hop nation that big country
Nigga please We ain't stop for no one
Wu-Tang Generator name I'm a shogun
Wu-Tang Generator name watch him smoke one
Talk a lot of shit but none of them will approach him
Gambino got first position the game is ballet
So graceful drive he don't need a valet
So angel fly as I wanna be
Mercy somebody show these niggas can't hurt me

But you're still the same
There's somethin' inside you
It's hard to explain
They're talking about you boy
But you're still the same
I'm afraid of the future
I'm afraid my parents won't live long enough to see my kids
I'm afraid my show will fail
I'm scared my girl will get pregnant at not the exact time we want
I'm scared I'll never reach my potential
I'm afraid she's still in love with that dude
I feel like I'm letting everyone down
I'm afraid people hate who I really am
I'm afraid I hate who I really am
I'm scared people will find out what I masturbate to
I'm afraid I'm here for nothing
I feel that this will feel pretentious
I'm scared I'll never grow out of Bro Rape
I'm afraid people think I hate my race
I'm afraid people think I hate women
I hate people can say anything
I hate caring what people think
I'm afraid there's someone better for you or me
I'm afraid this is all an accident
I'm scared I'll be Tyrese
I'm afraid Dan Harmon hates me
I'm scared I won't know anything ever again
I'm scared I never knew anything
I'm afraid I'll regret this
I'm afraid this doesn't matter at all
I didn't leave Community to rap
I don't wanna rap
I wanted to be on my own
I've been sick this year
I've seen a bunch of people die this year
This is the first time I've felt helpless
I take her round the corner then I gave the ho a bonus
Bitches wanna bone us we ain't cubic zirconia
But I will never own 'em so to me them bitches loners
Bank roll thick like that neck on Sabonis
But I will never trick you just get dick and balonis
Take that tenderoni and now she ride my pony
And cheese came with it like a snatch of pepperoni
You a she nigga run you back like a repeat

Too high can't come down

Fandango my mandingo we should do a movie
Groupies lookin' like the Yakuza in my Jacuzzi
Excuse me I'm on that ooey my pockets are life with Louis
Euros is different colors my wallet look like a Coogi
He who speakin' the least is Chief Keefin' the peace
Leavin' seeds in yo niece prayin' that she ain't late
Sprayin' like that nine now that shit my namesake
'Bino you so nasty ass like an ashtray
Smokin' Flying Lotus used to be Jehovah's
I'm in yo girl and now she feeling Polish like pierogies
They hopin' that they smoke us
N'aw man never that
Trippin' off that earwax Danny Brown and D-Stacks
Ill pandemic man that shit be everywhere
Midas is your highness and you Haribo like Gummi bears
Why I'm fly like a cockpit you don't fly like a ostrich
Stupid shit like a mosh pit can't believe this is Toxic

I ain't lovin' these fake hoes room smellin' like 8 Swishers
Room service like NBA I'm ballin' nigga
All them niggas fallin' like Autumn nigga
Talkin' shit I saw them niggas now their daughter want a picture
Rough ain't it Fuck famous
Niggas too real got the most haters
Wrote a story so Stephen Curry how it feel to be golden 
Why was I chosen 
Hanalei Bay with my bae what can I say 
I did it my timin' was perfect I'm comin' they know it
Becomin' the last great American poet
The flow Lindsay Lohan
Tired nigga retire nigga
My word is art like a hieroglyphic
What island is this 
Cabernet I can smell her talk
She wanna swim but can barely walk
She 'fraid of sharks she'd hate my lawyer
Atlanta Georgia got somethin' for yah
I'm doin' somethin' stay wit' it
I sport the Oakland A fitted
'Cause it's moneyball and I'm throwin' funny
But all the kids'll go get it
God dammit I'm ill
I got one question for the haters is your girl on the pill 

They can't let a nigga live 'cause the life is better
Eighty-five everyday why'd I bring this sweater
I fell asleep on the beach tiny pink umbrella
Fell out of my drink she yellin' What we doin' tonight
Fifty grands their first week you ain't doin' it right
Young Bino best friends with the show promoters
Good year my career is floatin' it's all me
'Cause I stay real the worst pain niggas don't feel
'Cause they ain't feel a nigga tried to kill a nigga
But he still went stupid
Silver stones on her and the game so clueless
These niggas ain't us
Hopin' that I diss you back so I can make you famous
I'm just tired of haters
The AK goin' off sound like cicadas
We the clique all day man I'm so Decatur
Me and Fam backstage yeah I know you hate us
But you gotta pay us
Let 'em speak at my peak in the game for a minute
But I don't know how
All these light skinned niggas came back in style
Ye lied to us pretty girls at my concerts
Flow so cold so you know it was my verse
Stank attitude but I like the way she diddy bop
Puffin' white O's body bang somethin' Nitty Scott
They want the old Bino so they try to rewind
The new Bino too ahead of his time
In a couple of years they'll have to say I birthed a couple careers
Chances are I get your boy a couple of ears you know it

To love you all the time
I don't have words for this part
But I know it should sound like this
To love you all the time
Runnin' through the moment as the sun goes down
And all I ever wanted was to hear that sound
I stunt hard I make it work yeah

Childish Gambino lame niggas never heard of it
Sick Boi is the crew fuck these niggas with a dirty dick
When these mothafuckas gonna understand I'm serious 
I'm hard in the paint like I fuck her on her period
James Dean swag leather jacket white t-shirt
Rolled up sleeves nigga lookin' like a greaser
Word is born baby my dictionary's in labor
Listen to the Culdesac and know that was an ultimatum man
Why nobody wanna admit they like me just a little bit 
Won't be on the freshmen list guess I'll just keep spittin' shit
Never be the rapper with six hundred dollar shades
No iced-out chain Rod Lavers all day
I was hopin' they would see me just for me dope rhymer
They do me like my first house no co-signer
See you usin' qualifiers you don't even know
Even though I was rappin' back when Lance had chemo ho
Even flow Pearl Jammin' niggas can't leave me alone
I keep a bone for these girls who liked me back when green was low
Feel me though my thoughts

Runnin' through the moment as the sun goes down 
And all I ever wanted was to hear that sound 
But it's all for you to prove it keep on movin' keep on usin'
My shine my shine my shine

Gambeezy make it work somethin' let me check the syntax
Don't add an eezy to my name 'cause it has never been that
Aladdin on you fuckers prince of the game from street rat
Dudes fall off too steep like tea bags
Steady movin' don't worry about where I'mma be
'Cause I'mma be on these tracks like indie girls on Amelie
Honesty I'm rappin' 'bout everything I go through
Everything I'm sayin' I'm super sayin' like Goku
Fuck nerdcore fuck backpack
Fuck rap cool I make cool rap
I make music for wack blacks to blast back
In fact I swear the track I lie on's my last track

Running through the moment as the sun goes down 
And all I ever wanted was to hear that sound 
But it's all for you to prove it keep on movin' keep on usin'
My shine my shine my shine
Ooh take me higher
Running through the moment as the sun goes down 
And all I ever wanted was to hear that sound 
But it's all for you to prove it keep on movin' keep on usin'
My shine my shine my shine
Ooh take me higher
I never knew a love like this
Gotta be somethin' for me to write this
Queen I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter and finally decide to send it
Signed sealed delivered for us to grow together
Love has no limit let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault them 'cause I probably did it too
Because of you feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light
But they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I want to be the one to make you happiest
And hurt you the most
They say the end is near it's important that we close
To the most high
Regardless of what happen on Him let's rely

There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

It's important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night for you and the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon you my light
If Heaven had a height you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
For better or worse times I hope to me you call
So I pray every day more than anything
Friends will stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth havin' you work at annually 
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

It's kind of fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you shit pop when it's time to
Thinkin' you fresh suggestin' beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence
The time we committed love it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you
But as my equal it's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'ma lead you
And whatever's right I'ma feed you
Yo I tell you the rest when I see you peace 

There are times When you'll need someone I will be by your side
There is a light that shines special for you and me

I'll take my chances
Before they pass
You need to look at the other side
You'll agree and to the beat Com Sense'll be the sure shot come on

I met this girl when I was ten years old
And what I loved most she had so much soul
She was old school when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular not a church girl she was secular
Not about the money those studs was checkin' her
But I respected her she hit me in the heart
A few New York niggas had did her in the park
But she was there for me and I was there for her
Pull out a chair for her turn on the air for her
And just cool out cool out and listen to her
Sittin' on a bone wishin' that I could do her
Eventually if it was meant to be then it would be
'Cause we related physically and mentally
And she was fun then I'd be geeked when she'd come around
Slim was fresh joe when she was underground
Original pure untampered a down sister
Boy I tell you I miss her

Now periodically I would see
Ol' girl at the clubs and at the house parties
She didn't have a body but she started gettin' thick quick
Did a couple of videos and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave in goes the braids beads medallions
She was on that tip about stoppin' the violence
About my people she was teachin' me
By not preachin' to me but speakin' to me
In a method that was leisurely so easily I approach
She dug my rap that's how we got close
But then she broke to the West Coast and that was cool
'Cause around the same time I went away to school
And I'm a man of expandin' so why should I stand in her way 
She probably get her money in L.A.
And she did stud she got big pub but what was foul
She said that the pro-black was goin' out of style
She said Afrocentricity was of the past
So she got into rap hip-house bass and jazz
Now black music is black music and it's all good
I wasn't salty she was with the boys in the hood
'Cause that was good for her she was becomin' well-rounded
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just havin' fun not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung

I might've failed to mention that this chick was creative
Once the man got to her he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials she's universal
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs lookin' rock and dressin' hippie
And on some dumb shit when she comes to the city
Talkin' bout poppin' Glocks servin' rocks and hittin' switches
Now she's a gangsta rollin' with gangsta bitches
Always smokin' blunts and gettin' drunk
Tellin' me sad stories now she only fucks with the funk
Stressin' how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest before she got into showbiz
I did her not just to say that I did it
But I'm committed  but so many niggas hit it
That she's just not the same lettin' all these groupies do her
I see niggas slammin' her and takin' her to the sewer
But I'ma take her back hopin' that the shit stop
'Cause who I'm talkin' about y'all is hip-hop

I used to love her went and fucked up all the shit y'all

Hands to the Heavens no man no weapon
Formed against yes glory is destined
Every day women and men become legends
Sins that go against our skin become blessings
The movement is a rhythm to us
Freedom is like religion to us
Justice is juxtapositionin' us
Justice for all just ain't specific enough
One son died his spirit is revisitin' us
True and livin' livin' in us resistance is us
That's why Rosa sat on the bus
That's why we walk through Ferguson with our hands up
When it go down we woman and man up
They say Stay down and we stand up
Shots we on the ground the camera panned up
King pointed to the mountain top and we ran up

One day when the glory comes
It will be ours it will be ours
One day when the war is won
We will be sure we will be sure

Now the war is not over victory isn't won
But we'll fight on to the finish and when it's all done
We'll cry glory 

Selma is now for every man woman and child
Even Jesus got his crown in front of a crowd
They marched with the torch we gon' run with it now
Never look back we done gone hundreds of miles
From dark roads he rose to become a hero
Facin' the league of justice his power was the people
Enemy is lethal a king became regal
Saw the face of Jim Crow under a bald eagle
The biggest weapon is to stay peaceful
We sing our music is the cuts that we bleed through
Somewhere in the dream we had an epiphany
Now we right the wrongs in history
No one can win the war individually
It takes the wisdom of the elders and young people's energy
Welcome to the story we call victory
The comin' of the Lord my eyes have seen the glory

When the war is won when it's all said and done
We'll cry glory oh glory 
My motto is Chicago bitch
Everybody know you sweet what the problem is
Don't play dumb I'm the one that acknowledged it
Son of a bitch I imagine what your father is
Acting all hard when he hardly like that
You gon' mess around and make me catch a body like that
'Cause every song you make Joe is really ho music
I heard you said you wasn't a bitch because you sing
You a bitch because you cling like a bitch that's eighteen
Can't say my name but rap about a nigga's wife
You so black and white trying to live a nigga's life
I'm taking too long with this amateur guy
You ain't wet nobody nigga you Canada dry

Soft nigga Make no mistake I'm talking to Drake
It's the remix Rick Ross Common and that ass nigga
No man-to-man don't hide behind them other niggas
Nah this man-to-man You can't run behind them man
This is some real man shit right here

Say my name say my name
If no one is around you
If you ain't running game
Say my name say my name
You acting kinda shady
Why the sudden change 
Say my name say my name
If no one is around you
If you ain't running game
Say my name say my name
You acting kinda shady
Better say my name
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me

Yeah you know what love is
Even found it on the ground where the thugs live
My man had to dig deep to find his
Couldn't sleep 'cause on the real he had five kids
Live nig's real niggas express and taste it
At crap games black dames and big faces
Cases in court fam' showing love and support
You and your baby's mom thought that love was a sport
As men we were taught to hold it in
That's why we don't know how 'til we're older men
If love is a place I'ma go again
At least now I know to go within
At times it can take ya for a spin
Heartbreak hotel then you're home again
I've seen love make a nigga soul pretend
Like a story that he don't want to end

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me

It's all love where we come from
In the hood love we was told to run from
That same hood where the guns sung
We holla love hoping it'd become one
Crack got so many lives undone
From lack of love many hide some run
I knew this girl with a son who dreamt of acting in plays
Demonstration with her man had her trapped in a maze
Trying to find herself again much of that she'd have gave
Love can free us to it some of us react as a slave
Funny we love 'em more when they're relaxed in a grave
Wonder if a thug is raw is he actin' afraid 
Everybody loves sun why do I attract shade 
Heard of the love of money but compassion it pays
Talk about it with my youth so she'd understand
What it is to be loved by a man

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me

Some say that I'm a dreamer 'cause I talk about it often
Seen the hardest nigga soften wit' his homie in a coffin
We walk and stand in fall in it
With the right companion we all in it
Mary sang a song about it having broad limits
In the game of life it's the scrimmage
Reminiscing on letters I wrote in my small days
A letter to the people love always
Yeah

How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
It's a place I got to be
Loving you is loving me
How beautiful love can be
On the streets love is hard to see
Gotta reach that frequency
Loving you is loving me
And on the count of three everybody run back to your fantasy now

She was a bad hoe
The type at the club niggas would grab her
Fantasized when I had her
In the bathroom sweatin' with her ass up
The body of a dancer
We had chemistry 'cause she was a Cancer
Thought forever it would last for
But forever move faster so I had to
Still I gotta pause
When I think about her in them draws
And she liked it raw
Like rain when she came it poured
And like a car that I can't afford
I would want it then want some more
The positions our frames explored let me know
She was secure back for more I wanna

And on the count of three everybody run back to your fantasy now

Freaky like the daughter of a pastor
Said I was bait for her to master
Little red corvette now she was faster
Wet dreams la Mer cream the bathroom
We make love and then laughter
And anyway I wanted I could have her
Said there were some girls that did attract her
A new chapter she was after so I said let's go to a place that you wanna be
Get what you want from her and me
Free love I wanna see
Hot sex in the third degree
You gettin' served while servin' me
Dirty words encourage me to rock steady

And on the count of three everybody run back to your fantasy now
You know they be asking 'bout Common where he at 
What that man doing now 
I'm doing what I do hip-hop yeah that's what I do

How can I say this fuck it I'm the greatest
I am the A-list for all these great debaters
Aw yeah we put them things in the air
When I drop a single it's really like a pair
Of Air Jordans important to the culture
If you ain't true to it callate la boca
Get my drink on like a coaster
Post up on the wall that Mike used to live off
Hip-hop Master Cleansin' I'mma get my shit off
Rollin' in a Maserati Gran with the lid off
I bit all like a monster live nigga this is my encore
Encore encore I rhyme for the commoners
My name synonymous with prominence
I'm to Hip-Hop what Obama is to politics

Y'all niggas man you soft muthafuckers
Yeah my man muthafucker
Then come around my crib
You know where I'm from
Some ho ass niggas
Singing all around me man la la la
You ain't muthafucking Frank Sinatra
Uh lil' bitch
Yeah this the raw right here
This the raw right here nigga
Sweet motherfucker
Sweet ass bitch motherfucker

I'm the franchise so I rock my own chain
No I said give 'em that eighties cocaine
Somethin' raw something pure so I stayed in that vein
The hero that he know that he cold
Like when it's below in the G.O. wipe ya feet off in the Regal
I'm king observe the throne and the dream
I have it supreme like mathematics
Yeah a breath of fresh air for you asthmatic rap addicts
Pro black magic this is semi-automatic
Rap we won't jam in traffic
The game need direction I'm here to map it
Uh some people say that they be missing creativity
But when it come to hip-hop it begins and ends with me
Sweet

You know man you should know where I come from
You should know who I am nigga
You should never wanna go against me
You know man you too soft for that man
I be seeing you man I see it in your eyes man
You ain't the type of nigga that could go against me
You get in my presence you gon' feel like a little ho
You ain't a man yet you tryna be somebody else
Man be yourself man you come around my crib you get your shit took
Huh Wherever you go you probably be overseas in Europe and get yo shit took
You's a ho you know you sweet
Ain't nothing you can do man people see that man
Broads be seeing you sweet
Done wit' you muthafuckas it's over for you
It's over for you
It's over sweet muthafucka
Mr. Blue Sky please tell us

Aston Martin king Luther with dreams
The young Denzel the way I move through scenes
I'm like a preacher that once was a fiend
A story of change that came with wings
Pretty as the skyline the sky is my eyeline
Son of the most so from up high I shine
Suited in Prada stay mellow like lala
Young fresh with dollars ladies go gaga
I'm the top of the class
Black Wall Street so my stock will never crash
Given what I ask pure religion and cash
From the windows that open I'm raising my glass
Daylight beams night life schemes
This is my inception I'm writing my dreams
Immortal view of a star doing what I'm born to do
I see the blue sky see the Lord's coming through

Ohh in the sky we'll find the light
Ohh ain't too high we'll shine at night
Now we in the skies blue skies
And we going higher that's right

It all started with a dream I wanted to be
The Lord put the blessing upon the MC
O to the M dreams were spoken to him
That's when I knew my flows would overflow to the rim
Open my eyes yes sir this is what I'm made for
To go hard in the paint like D. Wade or
D. Rose from the same streets that we rose
International heroes at world primos
Red carpet magic taking pictures with the president
Told him for health care my music is the medicine
My name holds weight I am never hesitant
Different state resident this is hood elegance
Classic pursuing my passion
Fashion now I'm Oscar party crashing
Immortal view of a star doing what I'm born to do
I see the blue sky see the Lord's coming through

Silhouettes of dreams that we had high huh
Even now it don't seem so bad ma
Close my eyes to see things in front of me
I'm gone now imagine what I'm gonna be
Dirty to worthy now I'm all wordy
My broad up in Paris looking all purty
Immortal view of a star doing what I'm born to do
I see the blue sky see the Lord's coming through

I had these dreams in my head of an endless sphere
I could see it from my window
Wouldn't take that long to get me there
Keep running til' I can go
Remember the beautiful things that life could give me
Crazy how I'm the one
Could've been anywhere but I'm sitting in the air
With the wheels up staring at the sun
Ohh in the sky we'll find the light
Ohh until high we'll shine at night
Now we in the skies blue skies
And we going higher that's right
I want to be as free as the spirits of those who left
I'm talking Malcolm Coltrane my man Yusef
Through death grew conception new breath and resurrection
For moms new steps in a direction
Everything a nigga do may not be what he might say
Chicago nights they stay on the mind
But I write many lives they lay on these lines
Wavin' signs of the times many say the grind's on the mind
Shorties blunted-eyed and everyone wanna rhyme
Bush pushing lies killers immortalized
We got arms but won't reach for the skies
Waiting for the Lord to rise I look into my daughter's eyes
And realize I'ma learn through her
The Messiah might even return through her
If I'ma do it I gotta change the world through her
Furs and a Benz Gramps wantin 'em
Demons and old friends Pops they hauntin' him
The chosen one from the land of the frozen sun
Where drunk nights get remembered more than sober ones
Walk like warriors we were never told to run
Explored the world to return to where my soul begun
Never looking back or too far in front of me
The present is a gift and I just want to be
Ghetto dreams

I want a bitch that look good and cook good
Cinderella fancy but she still look hood
Butt naked in the kitchen flipping pancakes
Plus she trickin' off the dough that her man makes
We got our own handshake her titties ain't fake
Fucking in the car 'cause we just can't wait
To get home early in the morn' getting stoned
Pretty with her eyes low money by her Bible
The type of bitch that B.I.G. said he would die for
Is the type that I ride and stay alive for
Tats on her back looking all tribal
She know shoes like she know survival
Well put together she weathered the storm
Seen her brother die so forever she's strong
Hear Beyonce's song and she gotta perform
Whether fucking or fighting we getting it on

I don't even say shit she can feel it
Eye talk's the realest toenails acrylic
Ass is a weapon and it's hard to conceal it
Baby in one arm the other is a skillet
Fried chicken macaroni raised on the back of Stony
Ghetto Prince she's my Apollonia
Like chick that had the back of Tony Montana
Reminded me a me of my of my mama
Knowing the drama like she know when to joke
Steal a nigga's squares not wanting me to smoke
I poke my head out of Benzes
My tweets is the streets that I know who my friends is
Endless love for the money power and clothes
My ghetto housewife watch reality shows
She might get to snapping if the cabinets ain't closed
When the cameras start snapping she's ready to pose

I notice all my flaws when it comes to writing rhymes
Subject matter be changing too quickly at times
So I keep it strictly 'bout dimes and stick to the story
Call me a pro in the pussy category
Had explicit experiences I shouldn't mention
For me getting women turned from sport to addiction
Powerful women playing the roles of submission
Lawyers on leashes congresswomen inflictin'
Pain onto my game wanted and I'm sadistic
They liked it they dyked it devices twisted
'til I get a nice chick to get me on some nice shit
Crib raising kids Labrador behind the white fence
But I'm still single looking for Cleopatra
African Queen yo look at me I'm a bachelor
Y'all niggas in trouble keep your girls behind closed doors
Cross your fingers be happy I haven't chose yours
She love glamour bought her Vera Wang sandals
Valentino bags is my etiquette my manors
Half hood half class photographers' cameras
Caught us out there the spotlight hope she can handle this
She can join me red carpet at my next non-profit
Events having sponsored by some alcohol product
Jumping out a Bentley with some fresh red bottoms
You live your dream with me when you were just in the projects

Yeah It's been a long time comin' from the hood
You know what they say Kanye
Slow motion better than no motion

I walked in the crib got two kids
And my baby mama late 
So I had to did what I had to did
'Cause I had to get 
I'm up all night getting my money right
Until the blue and whites 
Now the money comin' slow but a least a nigga know
Slow motion better than 

You love to hear the story again and again
About these young brothers from the City of Wind
Like juice and gin in the city we blend
Amongst the hustle titties and skin fifties and rims
Y'all know the Sprewells and trucks that's detailed
Heartless females that wanna ride in 'em
Felt the Southside venom in raw hides and denim
Pimp minds collide with 'em a system that tries victims
We livin' in my man in the fast lane pivotin'
On the block white is selling like Eminem
On the block it jump off like Kim and 'em
On the block it's hot you can feel it in your skin and then
Shorties get the game but no instructions to assemblin'
Eyes bright it seems like the fight is dim in them
Call my man cuzo like I'm kin to him
He tryin' to stay straight the streets is bendin' him

I walked in the crib got two kids
And my baby mama late 
So I had to did what I had to did
'Cause I had to get 
I'm up all night getting my money right
Until the blue and whites 
Now the money comin' slow but a least a nigga know
Slow motion better than 

It's all good in the hood like rats in gyms
Throwbacks and Timbs blacks and rims
Whether on ball courts or tires of all sorts
We never fall short with us it's all Force like Air 1's
Some waves some air guns the days of the fair one is over for
Cats is colder than four below with self I go toe to toe
Wondering if it's for the art or for the dough
Though I know to grow a nigga gotta learn to let go
Though I know the dough I got to bring back to the ghetto
Arrows on tarot cards pointin' to the grind
Po' livin' in more prisons pointin' to my mind shine the light up
Clench my fists tight holdin' the right up
Freedom fight in dark gear for the years to get brighter
Situations and jaws get tighter
My man trying to get his weight and height up c'mon 

I walked in the crib got two kids
And my baby mama late 
So I had to did what I had to did
'Cause I had to get 
I'm up all night getting my money right
Until the blue and whites 
Now the money comin' slow but a least a nigga know
Slow motion better than 

I know I could make it right
If I could just swallow my pride
But I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me
I no I can't let it ride
See I can't run away or put my gun away
You can't front on me

I break bread with thieves and pastors OG's and masters
Emcees and actors that seize and capture
Moments like the camcorder
You ain't killin' it yo that's manslaughter
Though paper can't change a man's aura
It can feed a man's daughter
I stand for the blue collar on the side makin' a few dollars
Like Sam Jack they maneuver through drama like

Ferrari Testas Armani dressers
Exquisite thick bitches that body bless us
Rest assured we getting festive in Miami now
Told my nigga Ye I'm about to win the Grammys now
Getting Johnny Cash old white folks know me now
Standing close to the mic like I'm Kobe now
We celebrate with shots of the hate because we got love
It's the pop life a lot of faces pop up
Known to tear the club and the block up
Going through the airport with more lye than an opera
Knew crooks who move books like Harry Potter
Get cleaners to get it cleaner
A legend like John Lennon I'm a dreamer
Tried to fuck the world she only let me finger
Mind trips to Medina to visit the redeemer
A hero I'll drop out like Hiroshima
Off sangria with two broads at La Esquina
Still opening roads for Omoye and Amina

And build skyscrapers
Walking on water building my faith up
Niggas with no heart I'm the pacemaker
Get the beat from No I feel the pulse of the Chi
Survival of the fit with hope in they eye
Taking notes from the sky to fly above understanding
They notes from the most high so I gotta land them
Career ain't random make anthems streets chant them
Rock roles like a phantom
Mad hoes like they throwing tantrums
I tell them I need space like Richard Branson
Dancing with wolves and stars getting full at bars
And then pass out like a pamphlet
Never taking Grants for granted
It's Common I'm high above standard
Fly nigga keep my feet planted
To rock the planet I don't stop for panic
Maybe I'm a hopeless Hip-Hop romantic yeah I'm a dreamer

He introduced me I stepped to the podium
Said peace gave thanks to the holy one
Put my water up thought about my daughter for a second
The youth the living resurrection
Reflections of the sun glaring through the window
Now the audience staring at my mental
Feeling like the world the world is at my fingers
'Bout to speak to an auditorium full of dreamers
Kinda took me back to when I first had a dream
To be like the king that sang Billie Jean
Now it's gold records and I'm on silver screens
At the mountaintop you still gotta dream
To the dreamers

If I dream you're here
And you dream I'm there
We'll be nowhere near
You should just come here
If I wake you up
Only difference is
You can live the dream
Just believe in it

Once you find your shoulders dropping
And your speech gets slow and hazy
You better change your way of being
Before you found your brain got lazy
You can build a better future when you join the winning team
If you desire a bright tomorrow you must build a brighter dream
Dare to let your dreams reach beyond you
Know that history holds more than it seems
We are here alive today because our ancestors dared to dream
From Africa they lay in the bilge of slave ships
And stood half naked on auction blocks
From eastern-Europe they crowded in vessels overloaded with immigrants
And were mis-named on Ellis island
From South America and Mexico from Asia they labored in sweat shops
From all over the world they came to America
Many shivering in rags and still they dared to dream
Let us dream for today and for tomorrow
Let us dare to dream
I was rollin' around in my mind it occurred
What if God was a her 
Would I treat her the same Would I still be runnin' game on her 
In what type of ways would I want her 
Would I want her for her mind or her heavenly body 
Couldn't be out gettin' bogus with someone so godly
If I was wit' her would I still be wantin' my ex 
The lies the greed the weed the sex
Wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check
Wearin' her cross I mean the heart on my neck
Her I would reflect on the streets of the Chi'
Ride wit' her 'cause I know for me she'd die
Through good and bad call on her like I'm chirpin' her
Couldn't be jealous 'cause other brothers worship her
Walk this earth for her glory I'm grateful
To be in her presence I try to stay faithful

Faithful to the end
I'd like to be her very best friend

He worked with her she was his lady's best friend
Even if they don't try some ladies test men
And this was a test that was bigger than him
Some believe its the nature that is given to men
He had a good gig a wife a kid a decent home
One reason or another couldn't find peace at home
She asked Why do men always have to stray
He said I'm bad but not as bad as Eric Benet
I used to take 'em out to eat but they wasn't really eatin'
Mighta got a little head but I wasn't really cheatin'
It's hard when your lady don't believe what you say
And what you did in the past you gotta live with today
She asked if they could spend the night together
He thought and said I'm tryin' to get my life together
Went home to his lady these were his confessions

Faithful to the end
I'm gonna be I'm gonna be I'm gonna be so faithful
I'm gonna be I'm gonna be so faithful
A bitch nigga with an attitude named Cube
Stepped to the Com with a feud
Now what the fuck I look like dissing a whole coast
You ain't made shit dope since America's Most
Wanted deceased from the Midwest to the East
On the dick of the East for your first release
Your lease is up at the crib house niggas get evicted
In videos with white boys talking you get wicked
Natural born killa nigga you natural born God
Read rich got the nerve to say you rob
Hyprocrite I'm filling out your death certificate
Slinging bean pies and St Ide's in the same sentence
Shoulda repented on the sixteenth of October
Get some beats besides George Clinton to rock over
Rap career is over better off acting
What trouble I see you're managing WC and Wack ten
You backed into a four corner hustla
Lying on your dick said you was fuckin her
Use higher learning don't take my words out of 'text
Went from gangsta to Islam to the dick of Das EFX
It'll take the nation of millions to hold me back
From giving you mouth shots or hit with the pipe Ralph got
Chris Tucker ain't around it's your Friday it was good
I wasn't salty she was with the Boyz N the Hood

I see the bitch in you when you don't speak your mind
The bitch in you looking me in my eyes lying
I see the bitch in you simply hard you trying
The bitch in you for sho' it's coming out

The ump of this rap shit Cube I'm calling out
I break in and smack niggas that's in the Slaughterhouse
This ain't no East coast West coast none of the above
I'm from Chi I went to Califronia  niggas gave me love
There's a thin line between the fake and the real
Grafted ass nigga I see through your glass shield
Had skills once upon a time on this project yo
I'm a have to wreck a Ho'shea
I heard a hor say you're her favorite rapper so I had to slap her uh
And violate you a Muslim drinking brew
Your nigga ain't no Mac-10 he's a twenty-two
I seen you  you ain't say shit in ATL
Cube I like that diamond charm I might cuff it then sell
It out like you sold Kam and Threat
A year ago you wasn't talking shit about the West
Guess you knew your shit was done plus the one got you cable
Hoo bangin' you ain't banging shit but the table
And the circle mad ain't got no choice but to fight
Ain't none of y'all motherfuckers got a chance on the mic
Anytime you come out joe I'ma talk about you
Until you let that bitch in you walk up out you
Any last words before I hit the switch
From the immortal words of one a bitch is a bitch

I see the bitch in you when you don't speak your mind
The bitch in you looking me in my eyes lying
I see the bitch in you simply hard you trying
The bitch in you for sho' it's coming out

Yeah it's for the people

This is street radio for unsung heroes
Riding in they regal trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo I found the new primo
Ye' you know how we do we do it for the people

And the struggles of the brothas and the folks
With lovers under dope experiment to discover hopes
Scuffle for notes the rougher I wrote times was harder
Went from rocky starter to a voice of a martyr
Why white folks focus on dogs and yoga
While people on the low end trying to ball and get over
Lyrics are like liquor for the fallen soldiers
From the bounce to the ounce it's all our culture
Everyday we hustlin' trying get them custom rims
Law we ain't trusting them thick broads we lust in them
Sick and tired of punching it I look on the bus at them
When I see them struggling I think how I'm touching them

This is street radio for unsung heroes
Riding in they regal trying to stay legal
My daughter found Nemo I found the new primo
Ye' you know how we do we do it for the people

The people said that I was sharp on TV
At the Grammy's though they tried to India.Arie me
Got back stage and I bumped into Stevie
He said no matter what the people gon' see me
Can't leave rap alone the streets need me
Hunger in they eyes is what seems to feed me
Inside peace mixed with beast seem to breed me
Nobody believe until I believe me
Now I'm on the rise doing business with my guys
Visions realize music affected lives
A gift from the skies to be recognized
I'm keeping my eyes on the people that's the prize

From Englewood to a single hood in Botswana
I see the I in We my nigga yours is my drama
Standing in front of the judge with no honor
My raps ignite the people like Obama
The karma of the streets is needs and takes
Sometimes we find peace in beats and breaks
Put the bang in the back so the seats can shake
Rebel Cadillac music for the people's sake

Are we living in a dream world 
Are your eyes still green girl 
I know your sick and tired of arguing
But you can't keep it bottled in
Jealousy we got to swallow it
Your heart and mind baby follow it
Smile happiness you could model it
And when you feel opposite
I just want you to know
Your whole being is beautiful
I'ma do the best I can do
'Cause I'm my best when I'm with you

Come close to me baby
Let your love hold you
I know this world is crazy
What's it without you

Put down your bags love
I know in the past love
Has been sort of hard on you
But I see the God in you
I just want to nurture it
Though this love may hurt a bit
We dealing wit this water love
You even give my daughter love
I want to build a tribe wit you
Protect and provide for you
Truth is I can't hide from you
May have to die with you

I know what you're thinking you're on my mind
You're right you're right you're right
You promise so fast you just might take flight
Hope your not tired tonight

You help me to discovery me
I just want you to put trust in me
I kind of laugh when you cuss at me
The aftermath is you touching me
It's destiny that we connected girl
You and I we can affect the world
I'm tired of the fast lane
I want you to have my last name

I know what you're thinking you're on my mind
You're right you're right you're right
You promise so fast you just might take flight
Hope your not tired tonight
Memories on corners with the fo's and the mo's
Walk to the store for the rose talking straightforward to hoes
Got uncles that smoke and some put blow up they nose
To cope with the lows the wind is cold and it blows
In their socks and their soles niggas holding they rolls
Corners leave souls opened and closed hoping for mo'
With nowhere to go niggas rolling in droves
They shoot the wrong way 'cause they ain't knowin' their goals
The streets ain't safe 'cause they ain't knowing the code
By the foes I was told either focus or fold
Got cousins with flows hope they open some doors
So we can cop clothes and roll in a Rolls
Now I roll in a Olds with windows that don't roll
Down the roads where cars get broken and stole
These are the stories told by Stony and Cottage Grove
The world is cold the block is hot as a stove

We overstated we underrated we educated
The corner was our time when time stood still and
Gators and snakeskins in
Yellow and pink and collared blue
Profiles glorifying them

Street lights and deep nights cats trying to eat right
Riding no-seat-bikes with work to feed hypes
So they can keep sweet Nike's they head and they feet right
Desires of street life cars and weed types
It's hard to breathe nights days are thief-like
The beasts roam the streets the police is Greek-like
Game at its peak we speak and believe hype
Bang in the streets hats cocked left or deep right
It's steep life coming up where niggas is sheep-like
Rappers and hoopers we strive to be like
G's with three stripes seeds that need light
Cheese and recite needs and BE strife
The corner where struggle and greed fight
We write songs about wrong 'cause it's hard to see right
Look to the sky hoping it will bleed light
Reality's a bitch and I heard that she bites

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living huh 

The corner was our magic our music our politics
Fires raised as tribal dances and war cries
Broke out on different corners
Power to the people

Black church services murderers Arabs serving burgers
As cats with gold permanents move they bags as herbalists
The dirt isn't just fertile it's people working and earning this
The curb getters go where the cash flow and the current is
It's so hot that niggas burn to live
The furnace is where the money moving the determined live
We talk shit play lotto and buy German beers
It's so black packed with action that's affirmative

I wish I could give you this feeling
I wish I could give this feeling
On the corners niggas rob or kill
And dying just to make a living huh 

The corner was our Rock of Gibraltar our Stonehenge
Our Taj Mahal our monument
Our testimonial to freedom to peace and to love
Down on the corner
Once the love was strong
'Cause the pain came down like a storm
I remained holding on
'Cause I want you 'cause I want you
I want you I want you

I've been thinking bout I've been thinking bout
I've been thinking bout you lately
Thoughts take me to when we were close
Addicted to your love feel I need another dose
I know it's a feeling that should be long gone
Things seem to come up when I hear our song
Golden brown girl it seemed so long
Since I heard your voice where did the king go wrong 
Emotions that they linger on
I guess 'cause I never knew a love so strong
So many hot girls I need your warm
The taste of your mouth girl I need your warm
Good food and love I need your warm
This here was made before we were born
A dreamer so I'm a keep dreaming on
It's kind of like 'The Breakup' with Jen and Vince Vaughn

Once the love was strong
'Cause the pain came down like a storm
I remained holding on
'Cause I want you 'cause I want you
I want you I want you

'Til what you got is gone
Yeah I like such and such yo a lot but the feeling's not as strong
We were like 2 birds that were able to fly
I try to pick the right words to say to the sky
Some days I would try but wasn't able to cry
I never been good at saying goodbye
I take a deep breath when the times is hard
When I reminisce over you my God
I spent many years trying to be the heartthrob
I guess it's only right that I got my heart robbed
The scent of a room that reminds me of you
A hint of perfume it reminds me of you
Take a look at the moon it reminds me of you
Hope the stars and the gods align me and you

Once the love was strong
We do what we do and we do what we live
I love this way 'cause I got it as a kid
With so much to give from it I never hid
The love that I wrote on the mirror it got smeared
My friends say it was a change for the better
But I say girl you changed my forever
Relationships they can be as strange as the weather

The revolution will not be televised
Yeah it's Common Sense with DJ Premier
We gonna help y'all see clear
It's real hip-hop music from the soul y'all
Yeah check it yo

The perseverence of a rebel I drop heavier levels
It's unseen or heard a king with words
Can't knock the hustle but I've seen street dreams deferred
Dark spots in my mind where the scene occured
Some say I'm too deep I'm in too deep to sleep
Through me Muhammad will forever speak
Greet brothers with handshakes in ghetto landscapes
Where a man is determined by how much a man make
Cop Cognacs and spit old raps with young cats
With cigarettes in their ear niggerish they appear
Under the Fubu is a guru that's untapped
Want to be in the rap race but ain't ran one lap
Ran so far from the streets that you can't come back
You tripping with nowhere to unpack forgot that

This is rap for real something you feel
And you know yes you know that it's rap for the black people

In front of two-inches glass and Arabs I order fries
Inspiration when I write I see my daughter's eyes
I'm the truth across the table from corporate lies
Immortalized by the realness I bring to it
If revolution had a movie I'd be theme music
My music you either fight fuck or dream to it
My life is one big rhyme I try to scheme through it
Through my shell never knew what the divine would bring to it
I'd be lying if I said I didn't want millions
More than money saved I wanna save children
Dealing with alcoholism and afrocentricity
A complex man drawn off of simplicity
Reality is frisking me
This industry will make you lose intensity
The Common Sense in me remembers the basement
I'm Morpheus in this hip-hop Matrix exposing fake shit

This is rap for real something you feel

Somedays I take the L to gel with the real world
Got on at eighty-seven sat by this little girl
She recited raps I forgot where they was from
In 'em she was saying how she made brothers cum
I start thinking how many souls hip-hop has affected
How many dead folks this art resurrected
How many nations this culture connected
Who am I to judge one's perspective 
Though some of that shit y'all pop true it I ain't relating
If I don't like it I don't like it that don't mean that I'm hating
I just want to innovate and stimulate minds
Travel the world and penetrate the times
Escape through rhythms in search of peace and wisdom
Raps are smoke signals letting the streets know I'm with 'em
For now I appreciate this moment in time
Ball players and actors be knowing my rhymes it's like

She walk into the court her knees buckle
Saying for a man to survive he needn't hustle
Seen and been through struggle her whole life
Made a transition from being his ho to his wife
Stifling the night upend the ATF bust in
Her daddy was a hustla so she love them
Looked at the jury how can they judge him she screamed

Before you lock my love away before you lock my love away
Please let me testify

Fear in her chest her face in tears
Had her man's back he was facing years
In her name though the place was his
They tryna take everything except the kids
For years she been through stumbling fights
While he tryna hustle that white
Up all night wondering if he's alive
Seeing him tried she bubbled inside and screamed

Before you lock my love away before you lock my love away
Please let me testify

The judge yelled for order the court
Reporter making her words shorter
His lawyer sat next to him
She could see how the trial was affecting him
It hurt for her eyes to connect with him
Using her lies for protecting him
They arrested him for murder and gun possession
As they read back her confession she screamed

Before you lock my love away before you lock my love away
Please let me testify

The court awaited as the foreman got the verdict from the bailiff
Emotional outbursts tears and smeared makeup
He stated he was guilty on all charges
She's shaking looking like she took it the hardest
A spin artist she brought her face up laughing
That's when the prosecutor realized what happened
All that speaking her mind testifying and crying
When this bitch did the crime the queenpin

Before you lock my love away before you lock my love away
Please let me testify

You accuse me of a you accuse me of a you accuse
Please let me testify please let me testify
Night blows stoves don't work hoes at work
A warrior so I wear 'em on my shirt
Wish I was free as Che was I spend a day buzzed
Trippin' on heights wishin' for Nikes in different flavors
The age of Kane and Big Daddy short-body Caddies
Uncles named Larry that never really grabbed me
My mother gave birth but she really never had me
Left to the hood to play daddy
With weight so they weigh they status on the streets
License plates that say they motto
This is Chicago in the heyday
Similar to Good Times I guess that I was JJ
A skinny nigga young girls with Penny figures
So many niggas stacked upon each other
It's the black upon each other that we love so much
Wonder how many of us these drugs gonna touch
Used to gangbang ain't really thug that much
Rather have some thick broads and a dutch to clutch
Went to school in Baton Rouge for a couple of years
My college career got downed with a couple of beers
Came back home now I gotta pay back loans
Same nigga same block same shit they on
Only thing different quicker they click that chrome
In my defense yo I had to hit that zone
Man to man I'm good workin' with my hands
My generation never understood workin' for the man
And of being broke I ain't a fan
Now I stand in the same spot as my old man
My life I planned not to be on this corner
I still wanna see California
But this is my world

It's your world

Life and death flow around us
Four pounds and pounds of bird from out of towners
It's hard to stay grounded
We stay high that's why old folks down us
Lost nobody found us the force that surrounds us
Ain't with us they get us on the ground and hit us
We paint pictures of the chains under their names and scriptures
Removed from Earth only to return through birth
Knew this girl sellin' her body wish she knew what it was worth
Between God and trash lookin' in every car that pass
With a walk that suggests head to milk niggas she was breastfed
She know dairy so she say cheese to get bread
In the area where it's more weaves and less dreads
Kinda scary amongst thieves
Said it was her toes but I could tell her soul hurt
She was cold turk growin' up she got to know hurt
Very well in a world where self hate is overt
Her stepfather thought he was Ike so her mother he strike
She's got to like like-minded niggas who liked crimes and figures
Doin' white lines and liquor see hard times had kicked her
In the ass it used to be thicker
Life is fast some choose to be quicker
I remember in high school she had a passion to sing
Now she see herself in a casket in dreams
These are the children of crack and rap blacks that lack
Self-esteem yo we forgot the dream
On our Jeffersons y'all but we forgot the theme
In the Chi we even rootin' for a garbage team
This queen never seen herself on this Corner
She still wanna see California
But this is her world

It's your world kids
I wanna be a pediatrician
I wanna be a governor
I want to be a artist
I wanna be a veterinarian
I wanna be a model
I wanna be a doctor
I wanna be a ballet dancer
I wanna be a football player
I wanna be a astronaut
I wanna be a obstetrician
I wanna be a doctor
I wanna be a nurse
I wanna be a fashion designer
I want to be a gym teacher
I wanna be a architect
I want to be a duck
I wanna be a wrestler
I wanna be a dancer
I wanna be the first African-American female president
I wanna be a police officer
I wanna be a rock star
I wanna be a gymnastics teacher
I wanna be a captain of a police station
I wanna be a drummer
I wanna be an actress
I wanna be a superstar

Be grateful for life be grateful to life
Be you be mom's mean pie
Be little black Sambo with bad hair
Be a four star ghetto general be no one except I
Be a strong academic student be an A student in Sociology
Be food for thought to the growin mind be the author of your own horoscope
Be invited be long-living be forgiving be not forgetful
Be a proud run only to return to fight another day
Be peaceful if possible but justice at any rate
Be high when you low be on time but know when to go
Be cautious of the road to college taking a detour through Vietnam or the Middle East
Be absent of wars at any past or present fought amongst themselves
Be visual of foreclosure over your shoulder while beggin
A nation built on free labor for reparation Be a cartographer
A map maker be able to find Afro-American land
Search thoroughly it may be close to black land
Be the owner of more land than is set aside for wild life
Be cupid to world government
Be found among the truth lost tribe
Be at full strength when walking through the valley
Be not foolish as temporary king of the mountain top
Be a brilliant soul sparkling in the galaxy while walking on earth
Be loved by God as much as God loved Gandhi and Martin Luther King
We say the facts and if they lie
We comin' back for them
They might say but they don't know 

They say a nigga lost his mind
But in the scheme of things I never lost a rhyme
The thin line between love and hatred
I'm the black pill in the Matrix the saturated life
They say life is what you make it
So I wait quick on a spaceship so I can take it
As high as the stakes get when paper get low
Little Com I make righteous bitches get low
The richest man ain't necessarily the nigga with dough
My niggas couldn't tell it was me like Jamie in Ray
Paintin a day wit focused crime broads and good wine
I stood mine for forever and a day so goodbye
They never could say tell 'em J

Ahh  The sweet taste of victory
Go head and breathe it in like antihistamine
Fuck you expect I've got a history
Groupie love now gotta be them wheels 
Haters back down gotta be that steel 
I know they can't wait till ya outta ya deal 
Look how they did D'Angelo ask em how do it feel 
My best friends worry bout me
'Cause they know when you famous
And you had made cash
The media aims at us
And you be up so high
If you ever fall off it feel like a plane crash
But God don't ever give me nothin I can't handle
So please don't ever give me records I can't sample
So I could vacate where it ain't no channels
But it's quite ok for a gangsta to wear sandals
They say because of the fame and stardom
I'm somewhere in between the church and insane asylum
I guess it's messin with my health then
And this verse so crazy when I finish
I'm just going to check myself in again

I write just to free minds from Stony to Rikers
Amongst the lifeless in a world crazy as Mike is
On my paper whether its weed or Isis
They say life is a game so I play hard
Writin for my life 'cause I'm scared of a day job
Play my cards right they say I went too left
They showed me strange love like I was Mr. F
Played chess in this game of pawns and knights
They say my life is comparable to Christ's
The way I sacrificed and resurrected twice

I do dirt in search of a clear mind
Money talk somebody's gonna hear mine
Grind early before nine thirty
Got the nine and the thirty
Kiss of death you heard me 
My world ain't worldly any time could be my time
I get high but still ain't seen Chicago skyline
In my prime stakes is high 'cause it's beef
Out here in these streets
Everybody tryna eat off the same plate
Dead presidents we want the same face
And to think me and the president we from the same place
Four-hundred and twenty-one murders ain't tryna be of the same fate
If I die and go to heaven will I make it through the main gate 

Second row of the church with my hood on
My homie used to rap he was about to get put on
At his funeral listening to this church song
His family yelling and screaming I hurt for 'em
A cold world that's why we pack heaters
Listening to this preacher as he tryna reach us
I'mma need to go back I gots to get 'em
Back and forth in these streets that's the rhythm
Revenge is supposed to be the Lord's but I use my own accord
When I seen him on the porch cost my man his life I can't afford not to hit him
Shots ripping through his True Religion denim
These streets was my religion
I stood over him his life is over then
Now these keys got me locked up with older men
Thought these was the keys for me to roll a Benz
They ended up being the keys for my life to end

My money ain't straight my fam ain't straight
Ain't wanna push kis heaven couldn't wait
I was hurtin' couldn't get no work
You created me from dust that's why I did dirt
You said that the last shall be first
Now I'm in a hearse what's this cash really worth 
My whole life I had to worry about eatin'
I ain't have time to think about what I believe in
When the days of the kingdom for Chicago gon' come 
I'm coming back like the Prodigal Son and I got a son
And I don't want my waves following him the streets swallowing him
And I don't want no hollows in him his momma said she see his father in him
Hope it's the good things 'til life was over is when I understood things
Standing at the gates 'cause I know you've forgiven what I've done
I'm your son do I have the keys to get in 

Sweet Lord Jesus tell the polices to let a nigga breathe
My sinning father see got a shipment by the seas
See my niggas tryna eat whatever's on your plate
Save some for me the worst things in life come sitting six feet
Tryna hop the gate to heaven 'cause I couldn't get a key
But these niggas play for keeps and I gotta hold my own
Tryna watch my back 'cause these stripes ain't free
We still wading in the water cocaine blunts marinating in the water
Leina took a puff and then she gave it to my father
Used to take the bullets out so I could play with the revolver
Satan serenading ever since I was a toddler
Tell 'em talk is cheap niggas living for the dollar
So in God we trust leave the praying to my momma though
Another motherfucker out of control
Just walking my soles low lit up with the abuse
They wasn't for show I promise every pistol was used
See I was waking up afraid to see my name on the news
Broad day bare faced giving niggas the blues
Nigga who you They know me on the streets where I grew
If you ain't from around here you get gunned down here
Make the best from the least on the quest for them keys
To the kingdom

We were from different cities on the same block
Grew up in different circles in the same spot
Like raindrops we fall in love giving our all
Showing her ring off like a player at the ball
I recall the walls that I had up
Attracted to women for things that didn't matter
Ka-clow boom pop Sound of my heart when it drop
The night that I met her it might be forever
I hear people saying that they like us together
I ain't afraid to gamble when life is getting better
With you I admit I had issues
Like ebony your essence your pedigree your presence
It's more than clothes can say for you
When I shop I gotta spend more than a day for you
I pray for you and us that we imbue through lust
And accrue the trust let's shake off the dust
From the cloth

Oh you're worried about when people stop and stare
That's just a tear on those beautiful clothes you wear
Cut from the same cloth you just want to wear
But that's just a tear because girl I can get you fresh

This is tailor-made love fit like a snug
Anything we can bear so let's have some cubs
You were there when my 'cause passed away
Not only does love but life hatches day
I appreciate the hugs and the days I breed with you
Strong seeds I can see with you the good word I read with you
Looking at things that we've been through
Things that seem simple
I know when to go hard and when to be gentle
Sentimental laughs and expressions
Let's stay in the present no time for second guessing
You said it's this cloth that makes you feel naked
The truth we address it that's so unexpected
Yeah that's the thread that helps us move ahead
Your hunger for affection will always be fed
Thank God we never sped and let love take its course
'Cause what's inside of us no need to outsource
The cloth

Hey lover we can cover each other
Through the coldest nights tight never smother
It's two things that seems to hold us together
God is our tailor and forever
Over the global my vocals be travelin' unravelin' my abdomen
It's slime that's babblin' grammatics that are masculine
I grab the men verbally badgering broads
I wish that Madelyne was back on Video LP
I went against all odds and got a even steven
Proceed to read and not believin' everything I'm readin'
But my brain was bleedin' needin' feedin' and exercise
I didn't seek the best of buys it's a lie to textualize
I analyze where I rest my eyes
And chastise the best of guys with punchlines
I'm Nestle when it's crunch-time
For your mind like one time
If poetry was pussy I'd be sunshine
'Cause I deliver like the Sun-Times
Confined in the dumb rhymes I combine
I'm hype like I'm unsigned my diet I un-swine
Eating beef sometimes I try to cut back on that shit
This rap shit is truly outta control
My style is too developed to be arrested
It's the freestyle so now it's out on parole
They tried to hold my soul in a holding cell so I would sell
I bonded with a break and had enough to make bail
A mister fell on his knee for the jury
I asked No for his ID and the judge thought there was two of me
Motion for a recess to retest my fingerprints
They relinquished Sense 'cause I was guilty in a sense

I ride the rhythm like a Schwinn bike when in dim light
I use insight to enlight devices hit the skin tight
Words of wisdom wail from my windpipe imagination's in flight
I send light like Ben's kite I've been bright
Get open like on gym nights and in fights I send rights
Don't hook with skins my friends like I spend nights up in dykes
In spite I've been indicted as a freak of all trades
I bathe in bass lines rinse in riffs dry in drums
Come from a tribe of bums hooked on Negro and mums
Had to halt with the malt liquor
'Cause off the malt liquor I fought niggas
Now my speech and thoughts quicker
Cruise the Southside streets with no heat and no sticker
Family's got my back and we don't get no thicker
Bros' got my back and we don't now check it
I'm a ho but not a ho nigga ain't scared of no nigga
When it's my turn to go I gotta go
And I'm gone with the storm

Everybody home ain't nobody gone
And I got all my niggas around
It feel good don't it Getting hood on it
And I got all my niggas around
I got a couple minutes in town
A couple hundred bitches around
So baby go on and get us a round
'Cause I got all my niggas around let's celebrate

We partying yeah got body and
Exotic broads lobbying Spanish Somalian
Fly we live it 'til we die
We living in the night looking in the eye
On our paper 'til we get it like Dubai
Chi niggas stand up plastic cups
Girls with the drastic butts that ask for bucks
It don't stop here
Bottles of Veuve pop here
And we gonna get around like 2Pac's here
Celebrate like it's new year
Some bomb broads coming type nuclear
Yeah it's so ridiculous
Lit the medicinal passed it give-and-go

In my Paul Smith like an alcoholic
My guys I used to hoop with is now who I ball with
This raw bitch came in looking flawless
Tonight she'll be giving conscious headlights 
Beaming from the Beemer that her momma bought her
I got to act right for her like I'm an author
Look where drama brought us look where karma brought us
Married to the game like Usher we was caught up
Now we got some rap broads we can call up
You niggas come around keep the wall up
Smoke blowing out thinking of tomorrow and the simple things
Hustlers from the go how far we done came

Ah another night we love the night
For the life getting bugged tonight
Wait 'til I get my money right
Told you it's gonna be on like the business that we lean on
Put my team on get our heat on
Ah I knew her when she strip her name was Chardonnay
My niggas move work even on a holiday
We come from porches and alleyways
I'm the big ticket don't need no one to validate

We ain't gotta wait
It's a toast to you and me
Bills ain't so bad celebrate that
Party in the yard 'til the lights come on
Ain't nobody crying
We've come so far been climbing
Now the clouds they passed us by
C'mon and raise your glass up high
Southern leaves southern trees we hung from
Barren souls heroic songs unsung
Forgive them Father they know this knot is undone
Tied with the rope that my grandmother died
Pride of the pilgrims affect lives of millions
Since slave days separating fathers from children
Institution ain't just a building
But a method of having black and brown bodies fill them
We ain't seen as human beings with feelings
Will the U.S. ever be us Lord willing 
For now we know the new Jim Crow
They stop search and arrest our souls
Police and policies patrol philosophies of control
A cruel hand taking hold
We let go to free them so we can free us
America's moment to come to Jesus

The caged birds sings for freedom to ring
Black bodies being lost in the American dream
Blood of black being a pastoral scene
Slavery's still alive check Amendment thirteen bitch
Now whips and chains are subliminal
Instead of 'nigga' they use the word 'criminal'
Sweet land of liberty incarcerated country
Shot me with your ray-gun
And now you want to trump me
Prison is a business America's the company
Investing in injustice fear and long suffering
We staring in the face of hate again
The same hate they say will make America great again
No consolation prize for the dehumanized
For America to rise it's a matter of Black Lives
And we gonna free them so we can free us
America's moment to come to Jesus

These are the words of a believer
Achiever leader of the globe
Feeding souls of those in need
I bleed the blood of the struggle
Walking over troubled puddles
Hustles in my chest no hustle no progress
Extremities of life and it's process
Birth of a son death of another
With love I caress both mothers
And told 'em who's in control is the one that's above us
I walk where money talks and love stutters
Body language of a nation going through changes
The young become dangerous pain gets spent into anger
Anger gets sent through the chamber
It's tough when your own look like strangers
We are the sons of gangsters and stone rangers
If he could how would Ernie Barnes paint us 
Look at the picture hard not to blame us
But time forgives in the Chi where the young die often
Do they end up in a coffin because we haven't taught them 
Is it what we talking we really ain't walking 
Dues hustlers pay how much did it cost 'em 
Find myself on the same corner that we lost 'em
Real talking in they ear like a walkman
Thoughts spin around the corner to the world
When I see them I see my baby girl
Believe

The lord lives among us the younguns hunger
Become a means to get it by any ways necessary
under pressure children feeling lesser
With the steel up on the dresser killin' will aggressors
Destiny's children survivors soldiers
In front of buildings they eyes look older
Hard to see blessings in the violent culture
Face against weapons sirens holsters
That ain't the way that Langston Hughes wrote us
Soul controllers on the shoulders of Moses and Noah
We go from being Precious to Oprah
Cultivated to overcome ever since we came overseas
Today and the way that you can see we determined
Solar keeps burning shawty's know to keep learning
Lesson's in our life are like stripes that we earning
Took gramps' advice that Christ is returning
Like a thief in the night I write the beacons of light
For those of us in dark alleys and parched valleys
Street hits spark rallies of the conscience conquerors of a contest
That seems beyond us even through the unseen
I know that God watches
From one King's dream he was able to Barack us
The prophets nothing can stop us
Walk up in the thing got my campaign poppin'
Headed to the door and ain't a damn thing knockin'
Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin'

I wrote this on my born day it was a warm day
Niggas gotta eat we gon' do it gourmet
I'm hearing fuckin' voices like when porn play
Stay on your grind like foreplay
What more can I say Diamonds are for the day
That means to shine you find a way
Stayed on porches backyards and gangways
Learned strange ways between Cole and Langley
Champagne ambitions
I pour it out for my man who made his transition
Wars about paper pussy pride and ego
Born to fly call me the bald eagle
Open shows at the Regal for Daddy Kane and Eazy-E though
Boys in the hood is hard like kilos of heroin
The hero that came from zero
That's Ice Cold like Dre triple three yo
Pinot noir style better with time
I'm gambling with watches getting better with time
So I'mma ride this out for long as God allow me
They say time is money forever is my salary
I shine tomorrow with what I do today
Yo get this money put the diamonds on display

Walk up in the thing and got my campaign poppin'
Headed to the door and ain't a damn thing knockin'
Walk up in the thing and everybody with me mobbin'
Hit you with the street sweeper now you gotta get to moppin'

Bars in alignment stars in alignment
Raw off consignment God's in the diamonds
Evolve from the science power and refinement
Read between the lines hard to define us
Niggas that's behind us throwing up signs to signify us
In the Benz leaning like we biased
I've seen Len Bias that shit scared me
You can go pro and blow everything you have in a flash
The moment is to live it like your last
Moments that we have never living in the last
My time man precious like diamonds
Look through the glass see what I magnify man
I'mma be shining 'til I die man
I'm a rare diamond that's hard to find man
Climbing to the mountain top MLK day
To the streets I speak my piece like an Smith Wesson
Jewels I could run it for the hunted and the blunted
Dreams reflect clarity ain't no disparity
Between peace and prosperity so marry me

Reminiscing when I had everything on layaway
I'm rolling with me and my partner like it was Training Day
Way before the ballin' that was back off in the training days
Had a crush on what's her name the feelings never fade away
Older brother gang bang banging like a white cop
Said you can't take his chain away
Real player you can't take this game away
Slang away walk up in this thing like a real Rockefeller
But you can't take my dame away
Devil in a red dress but she got that angel face
I could teach her how to get it day-to-day
The G code is my combination
Catch me off in the bank thumbing through all kinds of faces
Catch me off in court beating all kinds of cases
Weed money pussy liquor that's my favorite compilation
Real nigga quotes I tote
Got some shit on the free but this is shit that I wrote
Legendary like The Goat who got game 
Give it a quarter rest while I make these quarter notes
My album niggas was expecting now my water broke
Before it I was sort of broke
Get the paper for the funnies sports and the horoscope
Order curry goat like Fluke Stokes order coke
You sharp with your rings and chain but you short of rope
At the end of the road trip still I'mma hold shit down like syndrome
Rappers are like Fox Brown trying to get home
Barely get your touchdown I'm in the end zone
You can't honor what I'm on then bitch nigga get gone
Fuck the wind storm my pen told the street folklore
Body language spoke raw
Don't talk to broads that are spoke for that provoke war
Stand out like cold sores claim you hard but you ho-core
George Bush and CIA you moving people to Guantanamo
I write like Richard for publishing while you sold yours

Com got rhymes Dug make beats
Sound complete plus unique the shit be sweet
You know the shit be real

People call me Com and collective with perspective
I draw crowds go off like car alarm sounds
Bomb like 'Nam sound tell your bitch to calm down
Must want to give me skull asking me to take my hat off
I'm ill raps I spit as if I had a bad cough
This crank nigga stole a style and ain't take the tag off
Playing yourself you can't come with it so you jack off
More heart than an artery jones in my bones
To see thugs in harmony it's gonna be some drama
If you try to sit Com down this ain't comedy
Shit is real like a station property crew is forming colonies
Commonly I hear these rats thinking they mahogany
On every rap hook sounding like a dog to me
In a reservoir I flow and go
On and on like Erykah or etcetera
Designated not to make hits but hit home
Out of proportion hit makers get blown

Com got rhymes Dug make beats
Sound complete plus unique the shit be sweet
You know the shit be real

Rap studs kill me with they hardcore ballads
Love songs is violent them niggas whole style is silent
I hate to staple the singers together
But in my head it's been ringing forever
And a day if you grew up on Marvin Gaye
While all you singers booty this and freak me baby it gets me
Emcees be insecure like them little ho niggas immature wearing bobs
If I got a show in your town I'm there with mob
Bukeing niggas and pulling broads is they apparent job

Com got rhymes Dug make beats
Sound complete plus unique the shit be sweet
You know the shit be real

I got a dream that we gonna work it out
I got a dream that one day I'm a look deep within myself I gotta find a way
 
My dream is to be free

In search of brighter days I ride through the maze of the madness
Struggle is my address where pain and crack lives
Gunshots coming from sounds of blackness
Given this game with no time to practice
Born on the black list told I'm below average
A life with no cabbage
That's no money if you from where I'm from
Funny I just want some of your sun
Dark clouds seem to follow me
Alcohol that my pops swallowed bottled me no apology
I walk with a boulder on my shoulder
It's a cold war I'm a colder soldier
Hold the same fight that made Martin Luther the King
I ain't using it for the right thing
In between lean and the fiends hustle and the schemes
I put together pieces of a dream I still have one

The world see me lookin' in the mirror
Images of me gettin' much clearer
Dear self I wrote a letter just to better my soul
If I don't express it then forever I hold
Inside I'm from the side where we out of control
Rap music in the hood play the fatherly role
My story like yours yo it gotta be told
Tryna make it from a gangsta to a godlier role
Where it scrolls and stow slaves and Jewish people in cold cage
Hate has no color or age
Flip the page now my race became freedom
Write dreams in the dark they far but I can see 'em
I believe in heaven more than hell lessons more than jail
In the ghetto let love prevail with a story to tell
My eyes see the glory and well
The world waiting for me to yell
Yo we gotta start respectin' life more y'all
You look at your brother man you gotta see yourself
Gotta see the God within him
We brothers gettin' changed real quick over nothin'
We losin' too many of ours

Knowin' you the best part of life do I have the right to take yours 
'Cause I created you irresponsibly
Subconciously knowin' the act I was a part of
The start of somethin' I'm not ready to bring into the world
Had myself believin' I was sterile
I look into mother's stomach wonder if you are a boy or a girl
Turnin' this woman's womb into a tomb
But she and I agree a seed we don't need
You would've been much more than a mouth to feed
But someone I would've fed this information I read
To someone my life for you I woulda had to leave
Instead I lead you to death
I'm sorry for takin' your first breath first step and first cry
But I wasn't prepared mentally nor financially
Havin' a child shouldn't have to bring out the man in me
Plus I wanted you to be raised within a family
I don't wanna go through the drama of havin a baby's momma
Weekend visits and buyin' J's ain't gon' make me a father
For a while bearing a child is somethin' I never wanted to do
For me to live forever I can only do that through you
Nerve I got to talk about them niggas with a gun
Must have really thought I was God to take the life of my son
I could have sacrificed goin' out
To think my homies who did it I used to joke about From now on I'ma use self control instead of birth control
'Cause a hundred dollars ain't worth your soul
A hundred dollars ain't worth your soul
A hundred dollars ain't worth it

I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
You said you would be here when it rained
Why didn't you stay

Seeing you as a present and a gift in itself
You had our child in you I probably never feel what you felt
But you dealt with it like the strong black woman you are
Through our trials and tribulations child's elimination
An integration of thoughts I feel about the situation
Back and forth my feelings was pacin'
Happy deep down but not joyed enough to have it
But even that's a lie in less than two weeks we was back at it
Is this unprotected love or safe to say it's lust
Bustin' more than the sweat in somebody you trust
Or is it that we don't trust each other enough
And believe havin' this child'll make us have to stay together
Girl I want you in my life 'cause you have made it better
Thinkin' we all in love 'cause we can spend a day together
We talkin' spendin' the rest of our lives
It's too many black women that can say they mothers but can't say that they wives
I wouldn't chose any other to mother my understanding
But I want our parenthood to come from planning
It's so much in my life that's undone
We gotta see eye to eye about family before we can become one
If you had decided to have it the situation I wouldn't run from
But I'm walkin' findin' myself in my God
So I can discipline my son with my rod
Not have a judge tellin' me how and when to raise my seed
Though his death was at our greed with no one else to blame
I had a book of African names case our minds changed
You say your period hasn't came and lately I've been sleepy
So quit smokin' the weed and the beadies and let's have this boy

I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
You said you would be here when it rained
Why didn't you stay
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
You said you would be here when it rained
Why didn't you stay
Here we go here we go again
Trayvon'll never get to be an older man
Black children they childhood stole from them
Robbed of our names and our language stole again
Who stole the soul from black folk 
Same man that stole the land from Chief Black Smoke
And made the whip crackle on our back slow
And made us go through the back door
And raffle black bodies on the slave blocks
Now we slave to the blocks on 'em we spray shots
Leaving our own to lay in a box
Black mothers' stomachs stay in a knot
We kill each other it's part of the plot
I wish the hating will stop  and the battle with us
I know that Black Lives Matter and they matter to us
These are the things we gotta discuss
The new plantation mass incarceration
Instead of educate they'd rather convict the kids
As dirty as the water in Flint the system is
Is it a felony or a misdemeanor 
Maria Sharapova making more than Serena
It took Viola Davis to say this
The roles of the help and the gangstas is really all they gave us
The salt of the Earth to get us off of sugar
And greasy foods I don't believe the news
Or radio stereotypes we refuse
Brainwashed in the cycle to spin
We write our own story black America again

Hot damn black America again
Think of Sandra Bland as I'm staring in the wind
The color of my skin they comparing it to sin
The darker it gets the less fairer it has been
The hate the hate made I inherited from them
But I ain't gon' point the finger
We got annointed singers like Nina Marvin Billie Stevie
Need to hear them songs sometimes to believe me
Who freed me Lincoln or Cadillac 
Drinkin' or battle raps Or is it Godspeed that we travel at 
Endangered in our own habitat
The guns and dope man y'all can have it back
As a matter of fact we them lab rats
You build the projects for now you want your hood back
I guess if you could rap you would express it too
That PTSD we need professionals
You know what pressure do it make the pipes bust
From schools to prison y'all they tryna pipe us
Tell your political parties invite us
Instead of making voting laws to spite us
You know you know we from a family of fighters
Fought in your wars and our wars
You put a nigga in Star Wars maybe you need two
And then maybe then we'll believe you
See black people in the future
We wasn't shipped here to rob and shoot ya
We hold these truths to be self-evident
All men and women are created equal
Including black Americans

My money ain't straight my fam ain't straight
Ain't wanna push kis heaven couldn't wait
I was hurtin' couldn't get no work
You created me from dust that's why I did dirt
You said that the last shall be first
Now I'm in a hearse what's this cash really worth 
My whole life I had to worry about eatin'
I ain't have time to think about what I believe in
When the days of the kingdom for Chicago gon' come 
I'm coming back like the Prodigal Son and I got a son
And I don't want my waves following him the streets swallowing him
And I don't want no hollows in him his momma said she see his father in him
Hope it's the good things 'til life was over is when I understood things
Standing at the gates 'cause I know you've forgiven what I've done
I'm your son do I have the keys to get in

Sweet Lord Jesus tell the polices to let a nigga breathe
My sinning father see got a shipment by the seas
See my niggas tryna eat whatever's on your plate
Save some for me the worst things in life come sitting six feet
Tryna hop the gate to heaven 'cause I couldn't get a key
But these niggas play for keeps and I gotta hold my own
Tryna watch my back 'cause these stripes ain't free
We still wading in the water cocaine blunts marinating in the water
Leina took a puff and then she gave it to my father
Used to take the bullets out so I could play with the revolver
Satan serenading ever since I was a toddler
Tell 'em talk is cheap niggas living for the dollar
So in God we trust leave the praying to my momma though
Another motherfucker out of control just walking my soles low
Lit up with the abuse they wasn't for show I promise every pistol was used
See I was waking up afraid to see my name on the news
Broad day bare faced giving niggas the blues
Nigga who you They know me on the streets where I grew
If you ain't from around here you get gunned down here
Make the best from the least on the quest for them keys

You know you need to preach the pyramids of Giza
Instead of sniffing lines popping thongs in Ibiza
Nigga are we not thy brother's keeper
We used what we had to stay alive like MacGyver
Started from the bottom now we really here
Started kinda blurry now we really clear
It's the Nat King unforgettable black king on a pedestal
The way he made words into edibles was incredible
Verbs and spices giving life out to the lifeless
Giving Christ out to the Christ-less
My handle with the dices been documented as priceless
Devils who used to laugh at me bow to me internationally
Rappers I gave birth to shot at the God blasphemy
Told these motherfuckers to never Jimmy DeGrassi me
This goes out to those that choose to use
Disrespectful views on original Jews
The chosen people of God getting slandered and abused
In the streets and the news by the seed of Yakub
The synagogues of Satan wanna keep us confused
That's how we lose niggas got the ill street blues
From Chiraq to England
Me and Common dropping bombs like the baby planes as we establish the kingdom
Dem boy wanna talk like them wanna gon come
But what you gon' do if you got one gun 
I sing a song for the hero unsung
With faces on the mural of the revolution
No looking back 'cause in back is what's done
Tell the preacher God got more than one son
Tell the law my Uzi weighs a ton
I walk like a warrior from them I won't run
On the streets they try to beat us like a drum
In Cincinnati another brother hung
Again he won't see the sun with his family stung
They want us to hold justice but you handin' me none
The same they did Kobe and Michael Jackson
Make them the main attraction
Turn around and attack them
Black gem in the rough you rugged enough
Use your mind and non power get the government touch
Them boy chat chat on how him pop gun
I got the black strap to make the cops run
They watching me I'm watching them
Them dick boys got a lotta cock in them
My people on the block got a lotta Pac in them
And when we roll together we be rocking them
To sleep
No time for that 'cause there's things to be done
Stay true to what I do so the youth dream come
From project building seen a fiend being hung
With that happening why they messing with Saddam 
Burn a bush 'cause for peace he no push no button
Killing over oil and grease no weapons of destruction
How can we follow leader when this a corrupt one 
The government's a G-Unit and they might buck young
Black people in the urban area one
I hold up a peace sign but I carry a gun
Peace y'all love
We don't stop naw we don't quit

I rap with the passion of Christ nigga cross me
Took it out of space and niggas thought they lost me
I'm back like a chiroprac' with boy survival rap
It ain't ninety-four Joe we can't go back
The game need a makeover
My man retired I'mma takeover
Tell these halftime niggas break's over
I'm raw hustlas get your baking soda
Too many rape the culture
Leave rappers with careers and they faith over
It's a war goin' on you can't fake bein' a soldier
In the basement listening to tapes of Ultra-Magnetic to the fact the messiah is black
I'll turn the TV down we can take it higher than that
I wonder if these whack niggas realize they whack
And they the reason that my people say they tired of rap
Inspired by black Muslims and Christians
Pushin' cutlasses dope and other traditions
In the conditions of the city

A black figure in the middle with chaos and gunfire
So many raps about rims surprised niggas ain't become tires
On the street you turn cold and then go screech
I tell 'em fuck 'em like I do to police
The beast is runnin' rampant
I'm in between sheets tryin' to have sex that's tantric
For the ghetto tryin' to make a get-up stand-up anthem
You spit hot garbage son of Sanford
What you rappin' for to get fame or get rich 
I slap a nigga like you and tell him bitch 
With your Hollywood stories on porches
We polly hood stories about who became rich
And whatever light they hit we wanna hit the same switch
You didn't know where to aim it you still remain bitch
I'm forever puttin' words together
Some'll sever mothers from daughters and fathers from sons
The name Com' has never been involved wit' run
Unless it's DMC or runnin' these broads to bein' free
I'm harder than the times you hardly scary
Holdin' gats inside you cats is Halle Berry
They ask me where hip-hop is goin' it's Chicagoan
Poetry's in motion like a picture now showin'
It's the city the city y'all the city
Uh the city y'all come on

I know you're thinking that it must be
Armor All flow 'cause it never get rusty
I ain't gotta say it man dog trust me
Bust somebody head with my nine where was we
Still rock the Prada before that rock the Starter
Niggas had the Georgetown the Magic way harder
Thinking back to the projects and they way they tore 'em all up
Like when I do a project and come back and tear the mall up

We coming from the Southside

The broads the cars the half moon the stars
I'm like Jeff Fort the way I get behind bars
Burn CDs with no regard for the stars
Come to the crib with conflict diamonds and they ours
Back in ninety-four they call me Chi-town's Nas
Now them niggas know I'm one of Chi-town's gods
We eatin' Joe you still talkin' no carbs
A conscious nigga with mac like Steve Jobs

Your fly is open McFly
The crowd is open I think I know why
I'm back from the future seen it with my own eyes
And yep I'm still the future of the Chi
Back in college I had to get my back up off the futon
I knew that I couldn't cop a coup with no coupons
Look at that neutron on his green like croutons

You in the building but the building's falling
You wouldn't be ballin' if your name was Spalding
My mind get flooded I think about New Orleans
Bout to school y'all niggas you should call him August
I'm the sun that goes down but I'm still revolving
Southside walk it out while still you're crawlin'
If rap was Harlem I be James Baldwin
With money in the bank like G. Rap we're calling

With niggas masked up like Phantom of the Opera
Dreaming of the day they push a phantom to the operas
Can't wait till they say Ye ran up at the Oscars
Poppa I heard his life is like a movie
Like when Em played him and Mekhi played a rasta
Mexicans gonna love it like it was for La Raza
But this is for the mobsters Holla
We some true Chi-town legends accept no imposters

The un-American idol tower like the Eiffel
Lean wit it rock wit it Black like the Disciples
Know when to use a bible and when to use a rifle
You rap like you should be on the back of a motorcycle
Caught a case of robbery and beat it like Michael
Your career is a typo mine was written like a haiku
I write to do the right thing like Spike do
Through conflicts that's crucial and drama that's psycho

You might have to spice it up
Spice it up spice it up
Take your life and
Yo we're coming from the ghetto
We're coming from the ghetto
Made in Black America metaphor for a predator
Been to the Mediterranean on my papers like a editor
I flow like a reservoir dog
Rap Tarantino off the chain like Django
Still let the chain glow where they bang though
And niggas get shot like camera angles
In rap videos put up on Vimeo
I'm where the buck fifty bicentennial perennial all-star
Fruit that don't fall far from Islam
When rap is dead I had the fluid that embalm
I speak you know I'm in the building like an intercom
Enter Com the world's most
Intricate integrated with imminent
Domain I'm feeling myself like a sentimental letter written to myself
Aspirin' for greatness wellness and wealth I'm cold I'm hard to melt

Uhh I'm more than a hot song or a hot album
Ask my ex I still live on like Malcolm
My spirit and style done a transformation
Make room nigga I don't need reservations
You sweet as a hotel I stay presidential
Strange to be sinful and know that Heaven sent you
To rearrange the mental I've seen things we've been through
It's hard for a man to claim gentile let me change the tempo
I be with broads that got they shit together
Even if it ain't meant forever still smoke the spliff together
The essence of the herbs the presence of the words
Yeah you got a chest but I'm treasurin' your curves
You walk past I'ma look behind you
Look you up and down to find you
Can see I was designed to give you power and refine you
You fucking with me we can grind to
Gather the better Black America

Yeah made in Black America takin' threats from a terrorist
We will never meet but the media feed hysteria
And I be inferior if I be in fear of ya
More godly than gluttonous but my supper's superior
You know the difference 'tween the kids with the lunch tickets
And the ones with the money in the cafeteria
I break bread with my brethren like a pizzeria
Spinnin' dough you'll find red dots over cheese be aware of your whereabouts don't be feeble
I'm pissed off tinkle is the onomatopoeia
You's just a little star  sure ain't me
Been a superstar since ma made me
My president is black 
I wonder if Pac thought we was ready for that or did we move too fast 
I don't give a fuck shit my grandpa glad
They pass that gun law or not niggas still gon' pop up dead

Yeah I'm the Morpheus in this hip-hop matrix exposin' fake shit
Used to borrow dollars now my sense ain't so common
Never been a racist but I love horsepower
I'm hot that's why I got the fans in the stands
Em fans googlin' enemies shakin' hands
Restorin' the balance detourin' the malice
We kill you motherfuckin' mice with a mallet 
This is Huey P Newton with a QP
Bobby with a Seale Fred Hampton on pills
In the Hamptons now that's ill what's happenin' 
I'm just trying to teach my homies 'bout the Emerald tablets
Stop the war in Syria over a bowl of cereal
Kill a instrumental then book a flight on Expedia
To the nation's capital Golf Wang radical
Black Lip Pastor tip the usher when he pass ya nigga
Welcome to Black America Soul

I came through the door with the raw Martin Margiela
Superstar status everything stellar
With some bad bitches and some ex-drugs sellers niggas already jealous
We in this joint like Bob Marley and The Wailers
She already wanna pick bitch don't be so over zealous
Go to the bar to get around like a propeller
The barmaid's name is Stella
I'm so appalled like McCartney that you would card me
Am I really mad Hardly I'm here to party
Niggas in the corner smoking that chicha
Seen a girl she had bottom
Wanna put some hands on her
She ordered Bacardi getting twisted in the limelight
Seen that ass 'cause I got hindsight
She was lit shining bright in a fit that was tight
'Bout to get that invite to a night over Egypt
I'm Tutankhamun kicking and spending this rap money

She was all couture in a Tom Ford
Security guard let me in 'cause I'm lord
Of finesse the under the rings the dress
Code is to always stay fresh
Aware of a chest 'cause I stay abreast
She was extra cold I'm here to de-congest
This nigga next to us was slopped and made a mess
Knocking over bar stools I hoped that he carpooled
I'm locked into my mood long as dude don't disturb my groove
I won't have to take it back to high school
Rewind No need to take me back in time
Keep my mind on the grind and the great feline
'Cause what's in front of me is this behind
Up north she's thick down south she's fine
Tuned in to what I'm doing
I'm so unassuming when I'm pursuing
The ladies the ladies a soldier of love like Sade
Showing love to this lady when this nigga tried to play me
Saw me talking to slim and started acting shady
Dude got foul like crack in the eighties
You don't wanna test this yo
You never know who got a Tec up in the disco
I'm not Hollywood nigga I'm Chicago
So I cracked his head with a motherfucking bottle
Baby you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
No one can always be an angel
When everything goes wrong you see some bad
Well I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh Lord please don't let me be misunderstood

We do this for the people that walk that path
Tryna get to their dream yeah uh 
He stood on the corner with the rest of them
Though he knew that this corner wasn't the best of him
Hard streets and a life that crested him
Dirt police domestic beefs that's festerin
He knew the President wadn't addressin him
Though dead presidents was undressin him
Two kids from hot sex no protection and
People don't see how AIDS is affectin 'em
It get hard to get the get the God question in
Can't find a job so you robbin and hustlin
He killed marks and sold dope for cousin 'em
Can't believe they would be the ones bucking him
He on the ground he could feel God touching him
He heard the sound of his moms sayin trust in him
At heaven's gate saying Lord please let me in
Or send me back to tell my people to be better men

Her body move but her mind was manic'n
Thinkin I don't know where they hands have been
Relationships with men have been so damagin
She thought back to when she was at Howard and
Dreams of doing scenes with Terrence Howard and
Broadway plays and dancin with Alv and them
The ones that make it always ain't the talented
Some dreams get lost never to be found again
At first strippin seemed so empowerin
Most every girl wanna do it now and then
But bein meat every day is devourin
Cats puttin paper where she put powder and
Life would break her now she powderin
She was high when she fell down and then
Crowd surrounding and heart was poundin and
She fell into a deep sleep the siren sounded and
Seen bright lights in the midst of clouds and then
Talked to God feeling like his child again
Said Lord let me live so I can make you proud again

The life we lead will always lead us
And we pray that he will never leave us
It's the price we pay I guess that's the reason
Why my grandma sang we all need Jesus 
Misunderstood don't let me be misunderstood
I'm just human
So we made it to this same end of the road
And we picked up lots of chicks and pots of gold
How I made it out with my soul

Ashtrays and cigarretes last days indigenous people
These are adventures of young black millionaires
I am the voice of the meek and underprivileged
The smell of success I want y'all to get a whiff of this
On the move like black slaves through the wilderness
I write it and still get invited to white Christmases
When I was born three wise men came to visit us
One a hustler one a king one a prisoner
They cracked the bottle then started giving gifts
You from Chicago we want you to deliver this
Show the walking dead who the true and living is
Separate the fake from who the real reals is
Hot tub time machine back to the Sybaris
Hats from liquor stores to avoid syphilis
Frivolous spending drunk nights with storybook endings
I guess it's my addiction to women
I was in France in to see Hennessy blending
Writing my own scripts like I'm Tennessee Williams
Now it's new beginnings like a born again Christian
On the mic victorious story is redemption

I'm sitting at the top I'm not alone
I'm standing here with my soul

Feed our souls with two fish and five loaves
Teach a man to cook it for survival
My dad said it rained on my arrival
Now a storm of the brain make these guys drive slow
Like my creed's Apollo
On the rock and roll with the coldest live show
For those before I came I made the song cry for 'em
Lyrical gymnast you set the bar low
This is the Kilimanjaro like Twitter you can follow
It may be hard to read like hieroglyphics
Written on the walls of Cairo check my youth revival
Truth inside flow I stand like Em did with Dido
Crash parties any live yo
Is libel to get banged like things that rival tribal slang
From the pride we'll reign kill the game and watch it die slow
Ali  I fight for more than the title
After bein' twenty-five you know just trying to survive in the world
About to have a little boy or baby girl Who knows 
Anyway just when you start gettin' that little age and experience to you start thinking about stuff trying to make the right moves
So bust it out this is what I was thinkin' check it

Yo the education of the Lon chicka Lonnie Lynn
Being my bloodline is one with the divine
In time brother you will discover the light
Some say that God is Black and the devil's White
Well the devil is wrong and God is what's right
I fight with myself in the ring of doubt and fear
The rain ain't gone but I can still see clear
As a child given religion with no answer to why
Just told believe in Jesus 'cause for me he did die
Curiosity killed the catechism
Understanding and wisdom became the rhythm that I played to
And became a slave to master self
A rich man is one with knowledge happiness and his health
My mind had dealt with the books of Zen Tao the lessons
Qur'an and the Bible to me they all vital
And got truth within 'em gotta read them boys
You just can't skim 'em different branches of belief
But one root that stem 'em but people of the venom try to trim 'em
And use religion as an emblem
When it should be a natural way of life
Who am I or they to say to whom you pray ain't right
That's who got you doing right and got you this far
Long as you know it's a bein' that's supreme to you
You let that show towards others in the things you do
'Cause when the trumpets blowin' twenty-four elders surround the throne

I've lived and I've learned
I have taken and I've earned
I have laughed I've cried
I have failed and I have tried
Sunshine pouring rain
Found joy through all my pain
I just wanna be happy with being me

Let me voice my concern
So many of my fellow brothers have given themselves a title that their actions didn't earn
Our ignorance is in the same breath as our innocence
Subconciously seeking to find an impressionable mind to convince
I've finally come to the realization why Black people in the worse place
'Cause it's hard to correct yourself when you don't know who you are in the first place
So I try to find the clue in you
But evidently White folks know more Black history than we do
Why're we being lied to I ain't know our history was purposely hidden
Damn something in me wanna know who I am
So I began my search my journey started in church
It gave my heartache relief when I started to understand belief
Hustlin' was like a gift spent my share of time in the streets
Taught me survival from this evil I'm just gonna have to deal with
And I felt like a fool when I tried to learn it in school
It almost seemed like a rehearsal when the only science and math are universal
Takin' elder advice read the Bible the Koran
Searched scrolls from the Hebrew Israelites
Hold on this ain't right Jesus wasn't White
Some leads were granted with insight
And it's all in the plan but it took me some time to overstand
He still created with the imperfection of man
So with following I disagree
By no means have I forgotten or forgiven what's been done to me but
I do know the Devil ain't no White man the Devil's a spiritual mind
That's color blind there's evil White folk and evil niggas
You gon surely find there's no positivity without negativity
But one side you gonna have to choose
Any chance to speak I refuse to misuse
So how can you call yourself God when you let a worldly possession
Become an obsession and the way you write your rhymes and can't follow your lesson
If a seed's sown you make sure it's known you make sure it's grown
If you God then save your own don't mentally enslave your own

I've lived and I've learned
I have taken and I've earned
I have laughed I've cried
I have failed and I have tried
Sunshine pouring rain
Found joy through all my pain
I just wanna be happy with being me

I got so much trouble on my mind
So I take time out my day
To pray and I say now lay me down to sleep
Hopin' that I keep my soul
Peep I'm gettin' old and this a cold world
And I ain't even got a bomber
Livin' with my momma it's the same routine
Keep my room clean I'm lookin' to do some new things
But ain't shit to do
I'm twenty-two catch
In the prime of my life I have no time for a wife
I funnel through the tunnel disgruntled
Tryin' to find me some light
In the rim of darkness I too sing
I may not be the darkest brother
But I was always told to act my age not my color
Not knowin' that my color was out of the original
So now I sing the new negro spiritual
It goes 'get up stand up
Stand up for your rights
Get up stand up
Don't give up the fight
It's like how can you understand the pain
When you never had to stand under the rain 
When it rains it pours
And it's about to come down hard thank God
I found you

As I walk down the road of existence
I get resistance from all angles
I tangle for cash
Hopin' it'll last 'til the end of the week
But all I eat is fast food
And you know how junk food goes right through ya
I stop at the liquor store grab me a six pack
Knowin' that once I'm done with that I'll be back
To get some more
Once I get started I don't wanna stop 
And I can't turn around brew I can't turn it down
Ironically I turn it up my liver I burn it up
It's my life I live it up the cup I gotta give it up
One day
I'm cruisin' down a one-way street
Life itself is an obstacle
As I maneuver through the manure I try to be responsible
I want a job but I ain't lookin' 
I ain't tryin' to degrade myself bein' nobody's Calvin I'm a couch bum
What makes it bad I had incentive
But that disintegrated to a state that stagnated
I procrastinated
I can't recall a day without bein' intoxicated or blowed
I'm dealin' with a full deck at any day I can fold
What makes it bad I wasn't dealt that bad a hand
And I had a plan
But things didn't go through
The way they were supposed to
Thank God I found you

It's like a jungle sometimes
It makes me wonder how I keep from goin' under I ponder
And try to keep my
Concentration In this idiotic nation
They say become a doctor but I don't have the patience
Adjacent to that situation
I want an occupation that I'm into
'Cause yet have I begin to
Live to my potential I went to
School for fourteen years and my best teacher was experience I reminisce
And wish I could go back in time to eighty-nine
When there was just' 'sunshine'
But now it's like I'm gettin' older there's so much strain and stress
I don't think I'll ever be happy until I rest in peace
Of mind and find who I am
But thank God I found you

Uhh yeah play at your own risk
Act like you know bitch I'm on some grown shit
Play at your own risk
Act like you know bitch I'm on some grown shit
It's the Thelonious super microphonist
You know us this rap shit we bout to own it

I got a bonus for the bitch that run up on us
I got a bonus for your bitch that run up on us
It's the Thelonious super microphonist

Uhh no time to sleep 'cause if you sleep you don't eat
Gotta hold heat just to make ends meet
Niggas living on the street while other niggas feast
Aight wit you it ain't aight wit me
Right gotta make money all my life
Gotta stay fucking bitches many types
Yeah you know what I'm talking bout
Yup stay turning these bitches out
Dick em down also dick em out
Throw something down whenever my dick's out
They know me so they restructure and reroute
They know me from Washington to down South
All the way to London to my nigga Common house right
It's like a game we never play  out

Nigga no doubt nigga get live or get knocked the fuck out
Word up just be about what you about dogg
Knowhatimsayin just play at your own risk
Act like you know bitch I'm on some grown shit
It's the Thelonious super microphonist
You know us this rap shit we bout to own it
You know it 'cause you can feel it in your throat say it

I'm bout to let my mind float
 
Get your third eye poked
Fuck game I assemble dope
Ness a nigga that's fresh as the 'fess
Studied this rap shit no need to mic test
You can feel it in your chest
Your B I feel it in her breasts
Plus you rhyme like a nigga wit his nipples pierced
We lick off lyrics in the streets and real niggas hear us
Dreamin when I wrote this box me if I go too wild
Still doin this shit like dude in Wild Style
Inviting wack niggas to dinner
I Trick Daddy emcees and I don't know nann nigga
Who can take it where I take it
You better goin to God like Mase did
Leaving crowds complacent
I move 'em above clouds whether on some surf and turf shit
Or thug style you can feel it in your body
Yeah y'all you can feel it in your body

Like if a twelve gauge shottie shell hit your body
You don't want it need to find your ass a hobby
Carbon copy niggas tryin to clone us
You know us Thelonious super microphone
You know this rap shit we 'bout to own it dun for real

Ay it's like a ritual
You been invited let the mortal body stimulate the place
With the grace nevertheless I stress
Let the music put a smile on your face
As for the ritual when it comes to spiritual excellence
You know I always leave you with the taste
I know you like it hard to the core
That's what you ask for you aching for the best
Hurtin like a sore in that ass like a ritual
Conversation with the most high makes me wanna cry
I wonder why you wanna get to paradise
But that itty bitty part of you don't wanna die
So pay attention to my word 'cause it's the truth
Meditation ease the mind and brings the youth
It's like a verse you could never read out of a book
Dropping the line in your mind like a fish hook
Word is birth yo I do it till the break of day
Pay attention to your art never go astray
Word is bond

Yo we do it and we don't quit
Sucka nigga you don't want it it's Thelonious
Owning this rap shit super microphonist and we known to spit
I spit fire like Esther on Sanford and Son did
I'm raw dude more juice than Sunkist
You want this see when J get to saying the rhyme flawless
Shit fly like MJ in his prime Off The Wall with mines
I'm grabbing my balls when I rhyme nine-nines busting plus
Ball all the time now stay on your mind like great sex
You ain't on my mind I'm thinking bout paychecks
Connant Gardens they bust like latex sex packets
Emcees they don't rhyme and ball they lyin' to y'all
They dyin' to ball the rhyme we do all the time
We do all the fine bitches they fall in lines
Me and my mans is something like the Source Sports
We gettin money a long time and y'all short
My niggas bounce and full rise and y'alls fall
You funny duke 'cause really you think you can do me
Should of let somebody else hook it
Numbers look crooked like King Kong shook it
I'm from where niggas bang gats when they celebrate
That's how they play don't let it be a holiday
Thelonious niggas if you testin us we get you laid back
Show you the definition of a payback
Thousand lives ago we were young and we didn't know
We were trading our crowns for our souls
Made the sacrifice headed back to the light
But be careful don't drown in the gold
I know it glows but it's cold

I'm from the other side of town out of bounds
To anybody who don't live around
I never learned to share or how to care
I never had no teachings about being fair

Have you ever heard of Black Stone around Black Stones 
The concrete matrix street organizations
They gave violations hood public relations
It was the basics to get big faces
Stay away from cases bad broads good graces
The hustlers was the taste makers and trend setters
They the ones that fed us hopin' that the feds don't get us
The era of Reagan the terror of Bush
Crack babies momma's a push we were the products of Bush
I'm wishin' for a Samurai Suzuki and a little Gucci
Stokes it was folks and coke and dope
Fiends choked off of smoke herringbones and rope
Rare jewels of a generation
Diamonds blinding us of real shit we facin'
Forties wasted on 'ceased Dion makin' the beats
When they air it out on at the parties we escapin' the heat
I could break it down like whatever you need
He squinted his face and rolled the weed

You know they don't see sometimes that in the neighborhood it's the exact same thi
It's the same thing over and over again

Have you ever heard of no limit three hundred six hundred 
Folly boy O block eastside
Where it ain't no conversation they just let them heats ride
Can't nobody stop the violence why my city keep lyin' 
Niggas throw up peace signs but everybody keep dying
Used to post up on that strip I look like a street sign
I've been out there three days and I got shot at three times
Felt like every bullet hit me when they flew out each nine
I be happy when I wake up and I have a free mind
I know haters wanna clap me up watch the morgue grab me up
But they can catch me later I been cool chasin' paper
Where I come from ain't no hope if you was claimin' that was major
Small crib big fam mom was workin' granny raised us
No food in the refrigerator I was bangin' pullin' capers that's real shit
Same niggas from day one boy yeah I'm still with
Better watch out for that jump shot 'cause they will hit
Homie take your shorty lunchbox and won't feel shit
I came from a place where it's basic but you won't make it
Feds buildin' cases judges who racist and full of hatred I mean
You ain't never seen the shit that I seen

In the Spirit of God
In the Spirit of the Ancestors
In the Spirit of the Black Panthers
In the Spirit of Assata Shakur
We make this movement towards freedom
For all those who have been oppressed and all those in the struggle

There were lights and sirens gunshots firing
Cover your eyes as I describe a scene so violent
Seemed like a bad dream she laid in a blood puddle
Blood bubbled in her chest cold air brushed against open flesh
No room to rest pain consumed each breath
Shot twice with her hands up
Police questioned but shot before she answered
One Panther lost his life the other ran for his
Scandalous the police were as they kicked and beat her
Comprehension she was beyond trying to hold on To life
She thought she'd live with no arm
That's what it felt like got to the hospital eyes held tight
They moved her room to room
She could tell by the light
Handcuffed tight to the bed through her skin it bit
Put guns to her head every word she got hit
Put mace in her eyes threatened to blast her
Her mind raced till things got still
Opened her eyes realized she's next to her best friend who got killed
She got chills they told her that's where she would be next
Hurt mixed wit anger survival was a reflex
They lied and denied visits from her lawyer
But she was building as they tried to destroy her
If it wasn't for this German nurse they would've served her worse
I read this sister's story knew that it deserved a verse
I wonder what would happen if that would've been me 
All of this just so we could be free
So dig it y'all

I'm thinking of Assata yes
Listen to my love Assata yes
Your power and pride is beautiful
May God bless your soul

It seemed like the middle of the night when the law awakened her
Walkie-talkies crackling I see them when they're taking her
Though she kind of knew
What made the ride peaceful was the trees and the sky was blue
Arrived to Middlesex Prison about 6 in the morning
Uneasy as they pushed her to the second floor in
A cell one cot no window facing hell
Put in the basement of a prison with all males
And the smell of misery seatless toilets and centipedes
She'd exercise paint and begin to read
Two years in a hole her soul grew weak
Away from people so long she forgot how to speak
She discovered freedom is a unspoken sound
And a wall is a wall and can be broken down
Found peace in the Panthers she went on trial with
One of the brothers she had a child with
The foulness they would feed her hoping she's lose her seed
Held tight knowing the fight would live through this seed
In need of a doctor from her stomach she'd bleed
Out of this situation a girl was conceived
Separated from her left to mother the Revolution
And lactated to attack hate
'Cause federal and state was built for a Black fate
Her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates
They fabricated cases hoping one would stick
And said she robbed places that didn't exist
In the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites
Through dark halls of hate she carried the light
I wonder what would happen if that would've been me
All of this just so we could be free
Yeah I often wonder what would happen if that would've been me
All of this just so we could be free
So dig it people

I'm thinking of Assata yes
Listen to my love Assata yes
Your power and pride is beautiful
May God bless your soul

Yo from North Carolina her grandmother would bring
News that she had had a dream
Her dreams always meant what they needed them to mean
What made them real was the action in between
She dreamt that Assata was free in their old house in Queens
The fact that they always came true was the thing
Assata had been convicted of a murder she couldn't of done
Medical evidence shown she couldn't have shot the gun
It's time for her to see the sun from the other side
Time for her daughter to be by her mother's side
Time for this beautiful woman to become soft again
Time for her to breathe and not be told how or when
She untangled the chains and escaped the pain
How she broke out of prison I could never explain
And even to this day they try to get to her
But she's free with political asylum in Cuba

You're asking me about freedom I'll be honest with you
I know a whole more about what freedom isn't than about what it is because I've never been free
I can only share my vision with you of the future about what freedom is
The way I see it freedom is the right to grow is the right to Blossom
Freedom is the right to be yourself to be who you are to be who you wanna be to do what you wanna do

She was the type to watch Oprah and the Today Show
Be on the treadmill uh like OK Go
Had a body A body that you can't pay fo'
That mean she had some Ds on her but they wasn't fake though
Had a drive for a drive for Rodeo
She spent pesos on those labels
Spin class at the gym strip tease on a pole
She was so obsessed with her body and clothes
To every party she goes tryin hard to be chose
They say it's hard for a pimp but extra hard for these 
Readin Us and People mag tryna get the scoop
Chasin a actor for a Bentley Coupe
She been through the ball player from the Clippers then came the pumps off
All thinkin she number one where she was just a jumpoff
Doin all she can for a man and a baby
Drivin herself crazy like the astronaut lady

He had paper since we was in we was in high school
Pop was a doc mom taught at my school
Lock with the rocks in his ears he kept jewels
Pushed a Maserati sport reading the Robb Report
Wanted to be Mike but he was never live at sports
Since golf is in he was on the drivin course
To live the rap life is what he was strivin for
Spendin cash at the bar to get credit
Drinkin Chaundon just because Big said it
They say Ye is but dude was big headed
Rocked the fur in the summer so somebody'd pet it
He had a fetish for shoes that's athletic
Pathetic on his MySpace page half nekkid
It's a shame what they do for fame and to be respected
Joe you coulda got it if you never woulda stressed it

They was one of them couples people said they were the it
Unbreakable like Bobby and Whit
Or Ryan and Reese or Kimora and Russ
Relationships can be dead but look live to us
I guess we all been through it where we try too much
Losin yourself and you're lyin and stuff
Wishin for the diamond cuffs in search of a ring
Where love is not a mystery it's everything

Real People walk in the streets the streets is talkin'
Often it's beef this city never does
People walk and talk in they sleep
Cold sweats and wet dreams
On how to get green our faith is all in a jeep
Black souls raw and they deep
Hypes tryna talk with no teeth
Shorties sayin' ball or retreat
A lesson we all speak at one point or another
What you expect from one who smoke a joint with his mother
Anointed hustlers in a fatherless region
Through the pain wish they know that God was just teachin'
We want decent homes
So dreams we say out loud like speakerphones just to keep em on
It's like a colored song that keep keepin' on
I guess knowin' I'm weak is when I'm really bein' strong
Somehow through the dust I could see the dawn
Like the Bishop Magic Juan that's why I write freedom songs
For the real people

I wonder is the spirits of Bob Marley and Haile Selassie
Watch me as the cops be tryna and pop and lock me
They cocky plus they mentality is Nazi
The way they treat blacks I wanna snap like paparazzi
We're the children of a better God searchin' for better jobs
We could cop ghetto cars tryin' not to catch a charge
They say the dope game is sour
Now they doin' homework that's when they follow you for hours
Come to your crib and devour all that you work for
Must be more than paper these niggas hurt for
Through the purple haze I circle days I rhyme that work for pays
Tryna reverse the slave's mind and insert the brave mentality
Heard that it's drama at home
Can a dude break free and still get honored at home
I was told by a chief it's the games nature
When you're glowin' some will love and some will hate ya
It's real people

Black men walking wit white girls on they arms
I be mad at em as if I know they moms
Told to go beyond the surface a person's a person
When we lessen our women our condition seems to worsen
The weary cursin' the sky
Talkin' to themselves givin' the version of why help and hurt in they eye

I'm writing shit that I feel
Raps are black steel in the hour of commotion the motion of Com
Is like that of a ocean devotion 'cause I'm the earth wind and fire
Of hip hop by Rakim and Short I been inspired
My shit knocks environments
Of cats with seventeen's tint time is money
The mind is funny how it's spent on getting it
It's sitting with descendants of Abraham
I went from bashful to asshole to international lover-self
Word to the mother on my last record cover it's felt

In this neverending battle to please
Niggas magazine writers emcees
Who request hot shit I freeze
And tell them where I was rose we always said cold
Hold your horses and your carriages
This never-went-gold nigga rocks shows carat-less
You not gon' respect self at least respect the heritage
Affecting lives is where the wealth and the merit is
I realize what I portray day to day I gotta carry this
And beats rhymes and life is where the marriage is
Had dreams of fucking rap broads it came true
Journalist I wreck shared the same view
Picked up a fallen angel on the path that I emcee
Familiar voice come to find out the angel was me
Times are we still close
From what you accustomed to hearing everyday
You know the dope-smoking gun-thiefting homies dying
I'm amongst it save the war stories for Private Ryan

Women cry children laugh men dance
I refuse to lose self and try to win fans
Over weight on my shoulder fluctuates like Oprah's
My refrigerator poetry's magnetic like ultra
You couldn't hang if you was a poster
Posing like a bitch for exposure
It's rumors of gay emcees just don't come around me with it
You still rockin hickies don't let me find out he did it
Got my eyes on the tiger eyes on the prize
Eyes on the thighs of Mary J. Blige
Imagining how good the cat must be
Stop eatin meat lost weight but I still rap husky
My verse depth is that of a baby's first step
Or the old lady who died and the nurse wept
I flow like cursive writing inviting you and yours to my openess
Shows allow me to cop range like a vocalist
But man does not live on bread alone
What good is a range when it's time to head home

Ooh that boy he radical
Talk that money talk emphatical
Who in the game had the baddest hoes
Home grown with no home phone
From the city of wind nigga win or go home
It's the Chi bullshit I'm on
Make a dome from a brick and a pocket full of stones
Hit them cones clips and crones
I don't play away games I got hitters at home
I'm a dime like six in the morn'
Me and Muhammad speak in similar tones
Go hard like pyramid stones
Stand the test of time cross the burning sands
With aggressive rhymes I'm blessed to rhyme
I invest in time
Like Superman stick out my chest and shine I'm

I ride fun facts that's actual
Keep it one hunnid that's natural
To get them new blue hunnid niggas strapped with flow
Shout out to black and DC make it capital
I done made enough I don't have to rap no more
Tell the truth that ain't what I'm rapping fo'
Got a whole lot so we can have some mo'
So rosey go to red diamond make 'em clap some more
Movie we are black actors
Makin' somethin' out of nothin' blak majik
What I do I own like magic
Status of the livest and established
Girl with the fattest I'm givin' you the gladdest
Night you ever had this

Neewteb ni tsixe I ereh ton ma I
Maerd ruoy ni evah uoy suoicsnoc eht ma I

I am the matter that cannot be seen
I am the conscious you have in your dream
Do not be scared of my dark energy
I am not here I exist in between
Yeah that's me I'm magical
I'm black I'm strapped with magic bro
I'm nothing you have had before
I'm everything but nothing more
I wanna get closer to you baby

Sweetheart you know that you most
Important at least on the West Coast 
I'm just trippin' it's somethin' about your throat
You think different and understand how I float
Got cribs on both Coasts
You get down but you ain't a golddigger
You got the soul with the figure to match
Your girlfriend said that this dude is a catch
Creative with the gifts plus he hit it frsom the back  
And places we ain't supposed to
We make the music baby you on the vocals
International lover I never stay local
Go to places that you never been
Beautiful outside even better when it's in
You have arrived girl you can come again 

You sexy I know brothers try to spit to you
But I'm the only one that can get to you
Lifting you my drive is shifting you
I opened you free it's like a gift to you
I truly am thickly and thankful
And as long I'm in your town I'mma stay
You know I can't escape you
No matter how far you're still my star
You was there when the marks tried to steal my car
Snappin' with me that's just how real you are
Sophisticated woman you understand a man
You don't call all the time just to see where I am
Put a G in your hand make sure you're livin' alright
Makin' love is me and I'mma give it all night
Turn over in the morning make it warmer and better
Long as we can be we can come together

I remember she sit there with her thickness
Never played a game but I heard about them sisters
A wise mister said love is gonna get you
But that ain't what I read in the scriptures God be with us
It was hard for me to take down the pictures
I was tripping I even called her sister
I could be someone you could talk to each and every day
But you were 'bout to marry be on your merry way
I'm singing through the pain like I was Mary J
'Cause we break up to make up like Mary Kay
Rumors leaving tumors on my heart now
We fell in love huh just to fall apart now
I get your calls and I try to disregard now
What was easy for us now is hard now
Huh Who do it better we used to move together
Now we not together is this our new forever

Hell nah I'm waiting on your call
Told you be I'll be back had to break down some walls
Issues that I had
Some say it comes from not seeing my dad
Keep moving on
Hard for me to stay away and stay in touch
Girl my heart is broke and I need a crutch
Thought I was okay but nights that I stayed up
Ass got me layed up girl I never gave up
On you and us I tried to take it day by day and whew its tough
I know your young and you gotta live your life ma
I thought it was the right time for me to wife ya
I must confess I miss the days of you laying on my chest
So confusing losing love I'm saying god bless
Who do it better we used to move together
Now we not together is this our new forever 
If your eyes are the window to your soul
Open eyes bring the cold
If your dreams keep you warm in night
Baby just keep 'em closed
If your eyes are the window
I can sneak in at night
In your eyes I can see your soul
Staring back into mine

She was a beautiful rose
From the concrete and heat she grows
In the dark room her life was exposed
Her picture of men we walk on all fours
Heart opened and heart closed
Every now and then she sparkles
You can tell she was hurt by the words that she chose
I'm thinking like Lauryn a rose is still a rose
Even when the door close there grows a new one
I told her it's some good men she asked me if I knew one
Her daddy left a hole because she never really knew him
Ok sometimes from commitment we do run
Rocking Lou Vuitton said she focused on the Christian
I'm speaking to her trying to enhance her vision
But not to be married with kids she was wishing

She said daddy take me ice-skating
Looking at the rear-view life's waiting for her
Gotta be there to support her
Can't really wait for a court order
She got the type of aura that's fun and vibrant
A lot of love inside got to help guide it
Daddy will protect it God will provide it
We all will be there so your soul ain't divided
Man how quick she grows
Looking like her momma but she got my toes
I suppose it's the age that she really need me
A lot of girls without them become needy
As she begins the race of life and love I told her
I can't run it for ya but God know's I'ma coach ya
Yeah yeah me and my man Common Sense
Rallying troops like Joseph Stalin

I'm about to make the name Common Sense a name you fear
Y'all niggas is scared I'm your worst nightmare squared
And I'm a make the name Canibus a name you fear
Y'all niggas is scared I'm your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware

I can tell by how you write you the type to run in a fight
I hold mics while you hold spite
Like a broken-hearted bitch don't give no fuck who your team or who you started with
Cameoed or charted with I house niggas like apartments with
Mic mechanisms I dissect a rhythm
Move crowds with kinetic wisdom
It's like a Malcolm X-orcism fuck the rhythm I hit him
I want him got and I get him auction his wack ass off then bid him

I'm creating the ultimate verses with perfect lines
Putting together the web of my rhyme one thread at a time
So you niggas need to stop testing me
Because you know you can't fuck with me stepping to me with insuperior weaponry
Exposing yourself to the verbal radiations
Saying you can defeat me is nothing but speculation
Lyrics unravel faster than bullets travel through barrels
Niggas be digging my styles like fossils and pterodactyls
Who wanna battle I'm bad to the bone marrow
The Earth got one sun but I walk with three shadows
With Allah my supernatural bodyguard
Niggas couldn't touch me if they gave me a massage
MC's will compete with lyrics and beats get crushed
I'll hit you in your chest so hard your shoulders will touch

I pursue sound fairs relaxed like Dru Down's hair
Other nigga's rhymes are like gang signs I throw down theirs
On knots I landed players get played like Hamlet
Supposedly nice taken for granted like life
I write twice and drop singles in record pools
Niggas I'm dunking like when cops mingle
Fuck hip-hop jingles rhyming big words and not saying shit
The clique that you came in with accent your flavor with
Like moose I go to the caves and get niggas off all fours
I'm the shit that's uncalled for the shit that you fall for
Far more advanced than a rapper whose career
You could only take a glance
I stand in a circumference of humbleness
But in the Chi rumble it's
Mistaken as a weakness when poetry's in motion
Like a picture I'm the main feature
Amongst hard working teachers and corrupt preachers
I make my living off of singles like Latifah
In between sheets like reefer with blunted senses
You couldn't make a statement if you was from a sentence
I'm cold with numb intentions

Yo the Canibus is a animal with a mechanical mandible
Coming to damage you spitting understandable slang at you
I be the all seeing lyrical hammerhead shark peripheral
With three-hundred sixty degree visual
When the signal was given MC's get bitten
With venom from a poisonous algorithm liable to kill 'em
My style will get in 'em way up in 'em
My face don't belong in The Source it belongs on the Shroud of Turin for certain
I grab mics and murder shit
It's wickeder than Satan worshipers going to Catholic church services
You heard of this the lyrical verbalist slash herbalist
The wrath of my cold-blooded verses is merciless
Rap snap get your ass cracked like bear traps
Contaminate your air sacs like tear gas
And I swear black try to battle me you won't last
I'll turn your ass into a dead ass
You ass fag I'll blow you to ashes with tactics
Strip you naked then make you hug a cactus you bastard
So fat to be a rap star taking pictures at music seminars
People know who you are
Now I got mad shorties that wanna call me because they saw me
Up in The Source chilling on page forty
Put this in your iPhone
You can find me on the internet talking to chicks
I be talking mad trash trying to get 'em to laugh
See if I click and drag long enough I'll get the ass
Bring it back to the lab on Mount Prospect Ave
Let your chicken suck me off and send her home in a cab
You know how we do liquid aluminum
Beasts from the East part two coming to see you

It's time I made the name Common Sense a name y'all fear
Y'all niggas is scared I'm your worst nightmare squared
Now that I made the name Canibus a name you fear
You still scared I'm your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware

Since I made the name Common Sense a name y'all fear
Y'all niggas is scared I'm your worst nightmare squared
And since I made the name Canibus a name you fear
Stay scared I'm still your worst nightmare squared
That's double for niggas who ain't mathematically aware
Catch another sucker duck MC out there
Still getting mine in the ninenties

Yo just relax take it easy slow down
I had this yeah I had this friend of mine
Who just you know he was moving too fast you know what I'm sayin' 
I told him to slow down he said the sun don't chill
I said I said still I said still you gotta
Just appreciate life sit back don't let it fly right past you
No matter what go on I'm still gettin' mine
No matter the year no matter the place no matter the time

It's like I'm fighting for freedom writing for freedom
These record company niggas I don't like when I see 'em
My ancestors when I'm writing I see 'em and talk with 'em
Hoping in the promise land I can walk with 'em
Shitted on so many rappers it's like I'm in the stall with 'em
Molest concepts stalk rhythms paid dues bought wisdom
As legends fall my godmother answer heaven's call
Preachers' daughters get fucked in the reverand's hall
MCs reckless eyeball why y'all wanna go and do that 
Must've thought I was solo the name just ain't the U-Ac
Like in the ghetto photo with one nigga in the chair
Holding liquor in despair gang signs in the air
I shine in spaces where time is just a glare
Hold the mic like a memory
Niggas say I'm nice with metaphors but these are similes
Street ministry my poetry's a penitentiary track is visitation
Sentences is life I'm like chief up in this demonstration

You squirm with discomfort wiggle and cough
Six days of madness and you might throw me off
On this great ball of stress that they call the earth
I'mma show y'all in rhyme just how much shit I been through
And all the places I went to always played the low
It's like a competition this mission here I'm telling you
Crash courses slow down you can't learn that quick
'Cause I'm the dead eye with the red eye from Chi to Lee
I thought y'all knew every year I grew I'm still growing
And in a year or two I hope my girl'll be showing
A male seed praise God I name him Moses
I lead people I want him to that's why I chose this
Now is the glass half-full or half-empty
Common why they tempt me
The king of the simply bore in mic
I always stay on top 'cause I give niggas what they like
I know y'all hate that why I feel I owe y'all everyday
If y'all hear it a thousand times it's gon' be the same way
Now I'm a peaceful man I don't want no stress
You know I'm still waiting for it

Yo yo some get Range Rovers some religion change-over
Angel on my main shoulder telling me remain sober
Token nigga game's over ain't no payola in freestyle
In battles I'm warring like a G-Child
Searching for the child in me this style in me
This release is like the piece that's now in me
They tried to assassinate me god like Martin on the balcony
Catch a flick at the Liquid Kitty
Trying to get a chick to kick it with me till the tilt
Told her my chamber's like Wilt
Built with her for a sec let her know I had respect
Less than a hour she was giving me neck yo I'm still getting mine
I love the way I am and can't nobody out here change me
 
Good Morning Vietnam I'm back
Is it me you're looking for
For the perfect beat sweetly oblique
I'm fresh I come clean but I can't whistle
While No dug in the crates I dug in my nose
And picked a rhyme any rhyme I don't have any time
To waste I'm hip  don't even trip
To an easy travel agent now we fly for free
I can be fly for free
You want some fire tree then buy from me
Some of the realest illest chillest cats you may see
In your life if you get one
Rappers are like jobs to me  because they get done
Here it comes I'm as Able as Cain to get raw
That's why the DJ's mix me I'm gonna bust dicks
This is not da bomb so save all your threats
I'm good to go and also I'm Rets
Rhymes I wrecks affects the roughnecks
Down to the preps in the Polos the studs with fros
Hoes with weaves the bald-headed to the dreaded
To folks with butters high rollers in rollers
Players with plats studs with stocking caps
I be rockin' raps 'til I collapse
Niggas play my tape about as much as they do craps
Hi C I'm free at last
I'm a free man free as World B
And like an early bird I'm special
You ain't that special as Ed and Vesta
So to myself I say congratulations
I'm glad you had the patience you better have the patience

Whassup Scony Rony I'm that boney homey from Stony
But hardcore is far more than bats and gats
It stems back to the roots of being true
What I look like talkin' about some shit I ain't do
I ain't shoot nobody I ain't shank nobody I ain't kill nobody
It wasn't us it was them
The Warriors I'm a warrior and still don't have to shotgun
It takes one to know one and no one can
Tell me how to be 'cause I'mma be me aight 
'Cause I'm a man now check it
 
Sometimes I get a good feeling
When I'm chillin' at the flat lookin' at the wall
Wondering can I come off of it I'm off a bit
On the mic I be talkin' shit
But some say my talk don't make no Sense
I'm tryin' to make dollars
My momma told me to go to school and be a scholar
But school ain't for me
So don't even go there I'm comin' out of nowhere to go where
Probably in about seven years I won't have no hair
But not only am I the Hair Club President I'm also a client
I come off like a toupee I still have to pay 2Pc Dark
A Raider that never Lost the Ark on the shot
But now when I shoot rock I be all out of breath
My boy Adefo wanted to be a chef
But he went down South and fell in love call me love
I'm like B.J. my Arm is Strong and I Stretch ya
Styles from East to West all across the country
I'm like that big fat woman 'cause cats wanna bump me
I probably would get bumped more if I was a gangster
But I am a gangsta call me the gangsta of love
I love my music I love my momma
I love myself I love you and you love me
And this is I'm out

Yo I wanna say peace to my moms my grandmomma
Lil Chandra and John yo rest in peace to my Aunt Stella
Rahsaan's moms Ron's moms Dawn's moms Corey's moms
Who are you These people be themselves y'all peace and love
 
Common 
Victory won in a world of Henessey and guns
Too young for the marches but I remember these drums
The stark reality of wars and battles
We fought for ours caught in ghetto tragedy
I talk to my aunt named Mattie Lee
And recognize the importance of family
Hand me a joint good music and room to breathe
Those that doubt Com' will soon believe
Can't judge the weave my lady had one
I'm more like a fool for soul and passion
The price of gas rises street life is pumpin' fast lives is
I watched Crash and realize that we all survivors
No religion or race could ever describe us
My guys do dirt move dirt but never really talk about it
Forever begins just because I thought about it

Living once again
We live
Then you're gone
Living once again
We live
Then you're gone
Living once again
We live
Then you're gone
Living once again
We live
Then you're gone

Ashes and snowfalls
I wonder when the roll call for heaven gon' come
Forever gon' come
It's a cold world and I can never go numb
Look fear in the eyes say I never gon' run
Sooner then later I know the cheddar gon' come
For now I write the world letters to better the young
On tree by jury together we hung
Now we let our chains hang and gang bang to maintain
'Ghanistan goin' through the same thing
It trickles down at each other we aim pain
I shoot for stars peace and exclusive cars
Through the ride I learned to earn hard
Watch gangstas turn God in the midst of war
No matter how much I elevate I kiss the floor
It was in the wind when she said Dilla was gone
That's when I knew we'd live forever through song

Here we are back in the studio again
Hey I don' need no cue cards
They got the engineers holdin up the cue cards
Oh they say just talk don't sing
Son I bet you feel like you and I've been here forever
Thirty years old red eyes beholding red eyes
I see my world's tears
Yeah origin is forever
Every peak will have 2 valleys
Hopeful eyes in the comfort
Of true protection and admiration of a child
Damn what I'm going to leave
I'll leave my one and only grain of spiritual sand
To universal scales of humanity all humanity
Forever is finding a solution to a solution
Tsunamis hurricanes
Following the trails of the African slave ships
Floods Columbine global warming earthquakes
Another somebody done me wrong son
We're still did you place your one grain
Of spiritual sand forever 
Confusion need a solution
The pot of humanity sift the ingredients
Of acknowledgment apology amendment atonement
We gonna work with the four A's here
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind

I heard a white man's yes is a black maybe
I was delivered in this world as a crack baby
Hard for me to pay attention and I act crazy
Gotta get over from the tip I watch the fat lady
Sing a song on how we guerillas in warfare
And I'm the kingest kong
They say we dreaming wrong
Them same strips that them older cats lingered on
Now the Walgreens is gone hope is killed fiends are born
We leanin on a wall that ain't that ain't stable
It's hard to turn on the hood that made you
To leave we afraid to
The same streets that raised you can age you
With other black birds that's caged too
A rage up in Harlem and the southside
Brothers is starving with their mouth wide open
Floating across state got the workout plans so they can move weight
The fate of the black man woman and child maybe

Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe
Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Black maybe

He had game since he used to hoop at Chatham
Neither the ghetto nor defenders could trap him
The stones had his back and they'd pat him
He was living a life they couldn't fathom
Colleges getting at him with all type of scholarships
Even if he went they knew he'd leave college quick
For the pros the one from the hood that was chose
The black rose that grew in the jungle
But humble stud still had rumble in his blood
Women all around giving him trouble love
You know the love when you up they down
'Cause you wrap a ball they round
Your win is their crown
Dudes in the circle he known for years
Shared beers and cheers but chose different careers
When paper and fame came they ain't know how to react
Them same studs shot him in the back

Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind

When we talk about black maybe
We talk about situations
Of people of color and because you are that color
You endure obstacles and opposition
And not all the time from  other nationalities
Sometimes it come from your own kind
Or maybe even your own mind
You get judgedyou get laughed at  you get looked at wrong
You get sighted for not being strong
The struggle of just being you
The struggle of just being us  black maybe

Can't come around
They gon' wanna bring you down
No one knows just what's inside
Doing dope and doing time
Why they messing with your mind
Yo niggas don't want none of this
Niggas know they can't fuck with this
Turn this shit up just a little more

I walk the night in rhyming armor bomb a nigga like a winter coat
Have him on Death Row searching for an Interscope
Yet I sparkle like Irene Cara
Symbolize dope like sirens do terror
Mary Lou just had a baby someone else decapitated
Flashbacks of past raps make me so glad I made it
Players is getting traded
I drop a gem on them who's style is jaded
My juice is grated
Shit is so banging niggas say it's gang related
On philosopher's rink of thought I've skated with precision
Crews is getting split like decisions
Com'a let it ride and collision
Vision like Coleco or intele I battle stars in stellar
Regions my thought scheme was my like my offspring
Now it's teething
My reason to rhyme applies to season and time
Seizing the mind body and regions divine
In mom's cookouts I'm leaving the swine
Verbal vegetarian squash beef with Ice Cube
Came in this rap life nude
Now I'm fully clothed with flows
You tricks can't hide behind expensive cars and clothes
Old niggas I expose like Luke does hoes in videos
With classic material imperial and rugged like
Got mag but my slugs a mic
You fake like a smile like a hug I'm tight
Skip ladies this is rip a muthafucka night
Downtown interracial lovers hold hands
I breathe heavy like an old man with a cold can of Old Style
Hold a Stone Isle profile
Mix between Malcolm X and Sef when I go wild
Hold mics like a second nut until the second coming
Humming coming towards you with power like forwards do
Hip hop you my bitch and like a Ford I'm exploring you
Some wack niggas be cool with them I stay cordial
Flow at room temperature cats is presumed miniature
Like golf soft like Tiger Woods
At real nigga angles I've stood with ways that's geometric
Don't need to rob banks with dyke broads to set it
I levitate to the occasion lounge like a lyricist
Rhyme wise you a rest haven
You sat by the door spooked like I was Wes Craven
You need to do more deleting and less saving
A praise in hell raising heaven
As the bill on my pager leavens
What you should have known from day one
You will on day seven
Hungry hip hop junkie in the city
Love ain't for the faint of heart
Start training this game is hard
And arduous you're gonna play in the dark like when it rains in the park
You're hardly conscious of the stains and scars enabling your partly clouded logic
To pay to impart bliss with arrangements of chocolates
Now you're working yourself out the same as when you strain' with a nautilus
And you're willing to embrace pain facing sustained negative consequence
If nothing you say when in love is embedded with common sense
Then do you really regret when you've shredded your promises 
Now I've tested the waters kid Sipped it rippled the pond a bit
Visits have been abolished and this shit's killing my confidence
Is this filling your conscience when distance is an accomplishment 
You best fix whatever's wrong and just move on and get on with it
'Cause You'll catch bigger fish in the sea if you manage not to drown in it
It's sad but proud or not most your standards go down a notch
When loneliness drinks at the bar you set too high
'Cause It isn't really my time is it Shit I just found the watch
But hearing the bell toll for me twice a day has me fearing my grandfather clock
And I can't die without trying my hands tied in knots
Knowing that I'll never learn to brave the waves if I stand by the docks
Love is hampered by thought if you can handle the prospect of
Death  it's as massive a shock
And to intellects it's a fuckin' smack in the crotch
It's a cancer that rots your soul tosses demons off of the road
Just use caution and know that love ain't nothing but a loss of control

Love'll have you nervous doing stupid shit on purpose
Brain out of service words slurred when you blurt shit
Screaming this non-sense shit in your verses
Feeling like a shirtless four-breasted woman in a circus
Furthurly trying to gap an unfillable void
Because of parents never transfering that unbillical joy
So girls create a false world of filling on boys
Exploited guys playing with her heart like her feelings are toys
But when you have it there's nothing like it you get excited
Seeking those who provide it on phones talking to psychics
Some fear it spend their entire lives trying to fight it
Living in a confusing Hayes like they're grooving to Isaac
It ain't the end of the rainbow with a treasure chest and a map
It ain't easily learnable with definitions in tact
It can ride your train of thought and demolition your tracks
Hittin' and bullwhippin you leavin' them slits in your back
But I've been a lucky one loving parents loving friends
But I still spend alot of my life loving sin
But I ain't a genius on it I can only pretend
'Cause over all it's an emotion I cannot comprehend yeah it's love

Love ain't the basis for action
In a nation of addicts pacing and waiting for seconds of satisfaction
Where the word itself is only fashioned in fits of passion
Hand in hand with animalistic orgasmic reaction
And the past isn't felt as a match made in hell
But rather its held as a latter day meld
Of common mistakes and nice intentions
But when false love retention is simply vice invention
It's only right to mention the fights you get in
Nightly visions of these Tina and Ike revisions
So what's love really got to do with it 
From prude women to stool pidgeons in soup kitchens
The truth isn't as eloquent so be intelligent
Getting caught out of your element just for the hell of it's irrelevant
And that word'll fit like a glove if you don't get right
Now live your life for the love or stop
So fuck the commercial tracks you be doin'
A brother got to eat
Yeah Why don't you rap for food then

The music makes me high
Even though I stay away from canibus like Wyclef
 
Similar to Christ 
If you know your gwan die 
Show no mercy 
You get hit with more bricks than New Jerus like Confucian rules
 
We spit raps that are totally murderous
 
So check out how these herbs get touched
nigga you ain't servin us
cunning lynguists with stunning English
Harry Renquist with the best speech
Roll with cats who smoke more trees than the slash and burn techniques
 
Red fleets Pulp Fiction style  
We make like fly swatters and smash pests
 
Keep your bodies looking like samples for the Rorscach Test so fuck around and get your team rocked
 
The plot's to have everything between L.A. and Queen's locked

She sits in bed with her halo crooked
She says she's never been in love before
She takes time to define what we'll never get
We're turning into enemies with benefits
Enemies with benefits

She the girl of my dreams also my nightmares
'Cause she be jigglin' it killin' it in her nightwear
Between mean glances that we might share
The space between us is like a lightyear
All in my phone like she's the NSA
All in my Facebook pretendin she me
The ghetto's trying to kill me and my chick's an accomplice
Text messaging ridiculous comments
I'd have to wash my mouth out to read you the contents
She might literally love me to death
We had a stairway to heaven til' I fell down the steps
Now I'm left with a pain in the neck
But she's my eye candy the flavor I savor
And I'm part Vader I think with my saber
I live in crazy town and I'm married to the mayor

She sits in bed with her halo crooked
She says she's never been in love before
She takes time to define what we'll never get
We're turning into enemies with benefits

They call me Lex junior
My ex like a six shot shooter sex ruger
She's a sex cougar
She texts we bang every time I sit next to her
Man she get me hard as steel I call her X-Ray
Coz my ex bust her neck during sex play
I get the cleanest dome I mean it holmes
She never be at home but she never be alone
Her boyfriend is a punk he rock a onesie
He think he fly pullin' stunts in his undies
But she my kryptonite
I know it's cryptic right
I'm sitting back with a pipe getting ripped at night
On my window pane the coldest rain
My enemy Miss Lois Lane

She sits in bed with her halo crooked
She says she's never been in love before
She takes time to define what we'll never get
We're turning into enemies with benefits

She's a devil in a baby blue dress
Who I'm mentally redressing as an angel through sex
Who be testing my mettle and yes in a way I choose the stress
And I guess that I settle 'cause I'm a slave to huge breasts
But it ain't worth it
Ask me again if my mind has changed on the situation in five days
And I couldn't say for certain
And so we stay in this deranged arrangement
My judgement Impaired like I was drunk on kamakazi's running a busted Kawasaki
Callin the love doctor 'cause I need a fix of this chick and it's sickening
Wish I could quit but my dick is mixing the signals and shit
Half of the time I see past these disastrous signs
And half of the time I keep asking if I'm happy to lie
If blame can be assigned then I guess I'll have to try this food for thought
You can always see the shape of the pan in the pie
Savage desire in me to taste her loving
So my peace of mind will never turn into a baker's dozen
I'm crumbling
Its about time like that shit that light up ya wrist
Real niggas keep pleadin' the 5th
Concealed dealings in the heat of the mist
In the league of the chimps
I'm so for real with bananas and clips
So I fail with the gangstas and pimps
Try'na prevail quick money attempts
Couple hits nigga thinkin' he rich
But I was headstrong dead wrong perhaps
Playin' scenes in my mind when a fiend relapse
Eyes rolled back in they head relaxed
But money feeds the J's to the feet of the cool
And my feet were famished after walkin' from school
Wood heels smokin' kill with a hooligan crew
Talkin' slick to the fiends even robbin' a few
Niggas lucky that it's rappin' that he happen to do
'Cause oh lo and behold it could happen to you

The politics of pushin' potent potion
One toke and I bet I got you open
Peep what I prescribe to my smokers
Give em the proper dosage
Gary boy with dreams like Michael to see the ocean
I was local til the white boy Joseph put me on different coasts
Then he left me for dead dog
So he could push the pussy pigs Sonic The Hedgehog
The crackers wanna profit off my topics of mockin'
Niggas rock it let it dry trap traffic and train hoes
Poppin' my Smith Wesson at polices in plain clothes
The ghetto just infested with felons
So whether its the fuzz or the thugs now you under surveillance
I got a letter from the feds in the mail
That say I'm connected with some niggas that's sellin' yayo
So share some information or you'll be sharin' a cell
Lock me up and swallow the key throw me under the jail
But Never tell I'm not a gangster

I tried to stay all the way playa when it came to game
But got benched in a sense when it came to Jane
I can't explain the deep breaths that I take in her presence
Found recollections connect to every ounce of her essence
I love her til she join with the air up above her
Love so strong it can't be wrong for her to share with another
Long as she touch my lips and my fingers fuck it we swingers
'Cause it's Jane that keeps me sane
For what the world gonna bring us
Can make a blind man see and forget his doctor's appointment
For her sheer enjoyment I'll even risk unemployment
Can it be Her first name changed to Calamity
'Cause if saw by the law in my car they grabbing me
Harrassing me asking me 'where did she come from '
Have me see a counselor asking questions thats plumb dumb
Trying to steal my love so now I'm constantly taking shit
'Cause now three times a week they wanna test our relationship
Shit 

Jane's all confused inside
Gone off that mary jane
She's making love to equalize
Gone off that sexy damn Jane

Yeah spread them legs jane I need a head change
Coochie hairs flame colored sweet lil red things
She riddles every area of my brain with deep tickles
Mary married her carries my pain Nope
An angel came to me one night chillin'
Next I know we break up roaches from cigars
We done finished
Jane doing things that made me search my soul
I's a young one she's an old freak that cuts slow
Leave her Right now you got a hellafied no
I guess I needs her that double edged ledge cuts throats
I love the please her or pleasure whatever call it liesure
You call her a crutch y'all hush I call her 'Retha
Undressin her loving the resin upon fingertips
Its over when I roll me a Fat Lady
Now sing it bitch

Jane's all confused inside
Gone off that mary jane
She's making love to equalize
Yo first I sprinkle the verse
By addin' words rhymes
Flippin 'em in a verse with lines
Then I'mma hit 'em disperse rhyme
Venom and then I'mma split 'em in half
Feelin' my wrath
Venturin' through parts of the South so dirty
You'll want to be given a bath
It's livin' a pathological lie to deny that I'm nice
And the truth hurts 
Wearin' a blue shirt the best buy for the price
To get six guys this live and nice on the mic
So don't diss us because we're fly
Until you try what it's like
I'm liable to slice at these emcee bastards
Leaving their knees fractured
Needin' every piece of their teeth re-crafted 
So don't front 'cause I see past it
You're harmless like Wolverine's adamantium claws
When they're retracted 
If the scene's backlit
Or seems static we'll wreak havoc
We'll beat batter to keep rappin'
A leech battle a dream shatterer
For three nanoseconds 
Count your paces one step to Tonedeff
You're Gone in Sixty Seconds like Nicholas Cage is

I'll leave you riddled with basics
There's no need for complexity
To be beside myself I need God next to me
Just kiddin'
I'm partially bullshittin'
The only time I take a loss pussy is when I lose kittens
I don't capsize boats
But I got crews flippin'
You catch it The message needs analyzation
Step and your boys'll be pouring alcoholic libations
I flew sick you knew this
I'll puzzle you doofus
Fuck mentally
Stretch you into a physical Rubik's
It'll take more than sticker rearrangement to change it
His language is so strange how do we contain it 
You can't just paint this up upon the canvas
Gotta get the mental picture
To begin to understand this
So anticipate defeat delete chances
Got your heads speared on lances
Doin' burial dances 

I'm giving body language speech impediments
Each uttered threat causes confident cats to stutter-step
Cut a reputation down to sighs too raw for porn overdubs
Plate of leftovers Eat some Eat some warmed-over thugs
A jaded wordsmith bleeding ghostwriter's pens dry
Getting on a rapper's nerves corroding dendrites
When my thoughts connect you ought to step away fast
Seems I gave cats ADATs the way they make tracks
Forget a scare I'm not generous kid
Spit Society of Nimh and indent it in lids
Indie Pennant is sick and this is just a quick reminder
If you lust to vic a cipher then I'll bus your clique to Rikers
All expenses paid no questions asked
I'll get open in the cut and leave your flesh a gash
Can't relax man the last time I took a breather
I got brought up on murder charges start the crooked fever

Hey yo I'm not a fella to riff with
I'm so nice Mr. Rogers sued my ass
For copyright infringement
Roll with henchmen
That will switch heads
From wanna be thugs to twenty-four seven bitch kids
Topping my shitlist
Producting cat bastards wantin' jiggy beats
For some wack rappers
Switch my style Who you tryin'a play 
My beats'll maraud yo' ass any time of day
Like Deuce Bigalow's chick
Whenever you do shit
The Source'll be forced to make the quotables
A three-page fold-out
No doubt I'm fed up with this wack shit
Bombin' the next kid wearin' Abercrombie and Fitch
And any jiggy rapper actin' fly on the radio's
Gettin' pulled out of rotation like a Firestone radial

Kashal Tee the hip hop scene I phatten
Not even my winner's belt keeps my jeans from saggin'
It seems I'm braggin'
But fiends been naggin' for my next release
I apply all my expertise and make 'em extra pleased
Even get the vexed appeased I make any brother feel this
All I do is independent like double helix
Sellin' out Well I hope that you're not
But how else could you afford all the soap that you drop 
You can't fuck wit me yo kid look
Takin' me out ain't no small feat you ain't Bigfoot
You should know who the heck you're facin'
'Cause my reputation leaves no room for speculation
Now battle is that you want to do 
What kind of man are you 
I bet you sit on the urinal too
Now that it's proven to you
They got a lot to tell us
She's got your heart skippin' beats like acapellas

I be a cryptic author
Writing poems on tombstones
Iam the nigga you couldn't bring home when at high school
I'm at the crib wit your bitch givin' me slow head
Split you up in more pieces than when Jesus broke bread
My clique is raw be prepared when you meet us
Kill an unborn baby and you still couldn't de-fetus 
I don't battle with rhymes
I'd rather battle with nines
Instead of using my mind
I'd rather shatter your spine
The closest you ever came to a punch line
Was waitin' for refreshments at the prom in late eighties
I'm super crafty super nasty super raspy
Fuckin' bitches with super asscheeks
You fucking faggots don't know what raw speech is
I beat a bitch until her whole body turn to cleavage
I'm hyperactive so I drink decaffinated
My left jab is fatal leavin' cats decapitated
Tell the Reverend Harris to pray for me Lord
I ain't gonna live
I don't believe I'm gonna live to get much older

Lights out so peaceful stressless
Things used to seem so restless
Forgive me please see I need to address this
Just haven't been this breathless since I met this
Woman who lept into my life when I was reckless
Mothered my blessed kid but was destined to exit early
Guess you can say I've been blessed with the best gifts
Reminiscing holding her necklace in my clenched fist
Ha it's funny how we move in sudden directions
Dedicated my life to the public's protection
Never remarried 'cause love's an investment
Besides I had a baby girl to worry about
That would struggle to blend in
Now as I think a weightlessness is interrupting my senses
A pulsing tension carries my very frame
I rise up in ascension wait 
I try to escape but I arrive at these gates
I see a figure standing guard who invites me to pray

I tried it on
At the gates of Hell
I'm going to lay down

I walk towards the figure that's extending its hand
I move to enter past the gates yet I'm met with its grasp

Slow down son there's things to discuss such as family
But first let us talk about vanity

Vanity  Man you're sadly mistaken
Either that or your sanity's shaken
If you'd examine me patiently
You'd retract on your statement
I haven't sinned flagrantly I've acted as faithfully
As any other single father
Who raised a baby girl graciously

Nakedly she was at your door after her mother's death
Ignorant to racial anger and other stress
Later had a mixed baby at her sweet sixteen
How did that fit within your picnic scene 

Sometimes it's too late to fix these things
The pristine dream was over
Had to face the fact she split these genes with his sick seed
With skin the darkest pigment seen
And so I kicked and screamed
Until we found the peace that distance brings

A mixed raced queen that was your thoughts about her mama
Up yonder went her soul your hate growed from ponders
On life being less trife with a white wife
So any instance of y'alls differences it was slice-slice

Oh my it's not her race my daughter's love flies blind
I couldn't take her making the same mistakes that crushed my life
I'm dumbstruck by these baseless allegations
I've saved too many lives of all creeds
For you to paint me as a racist
I've endangered my own safety to save babies from blazes
Black white latino even asian on occasion

How dare you question my motivation

No need to second guess your only aim was to be famous
Lord knows you've left behind scorched souls
Black children left chilling later found burnt whole
So sadly your glory's to come urgently
Sentenced to fight fires for eternity
We about to get into the seasons
The seasons of hip hop
How we gonna start it 

As we spring back to the past it was all happening fast
We glorified coke and smoking crack in a glass
When b-boys danced to the latest jam
You could say this man was the greatest fan
When shoelaces were fat and all the rapper's faces were black
And light-brown a box with the right sound was all you needed
When it blast they must move
You just proved you're hard like L in Krush Groove
And songs started to drop Ain't nobody start at the top
Before Preme learned the art of the chop
The game started to bloom and blossom
And masters ready for the cermony like a groom in costume
Growth from the rain of the previous years
I took notes from what I heard through these devious ears

As Summer's heatwaves ascended in it's splendid manner
Green was flooding our scene although the skin was tanner
Fuck The Police jumpin over radio scanners
It was hot in the shade wet paint all over the canvas
Fuck Vanilla Ice cones we had T Cube's America's Most
And wanted that Chronic on the Left-Coast
Talent pools were full and fresh for swimming
Backstrokin' through Dark Sides and Illmatic beginnings
Them lemonade stands would make you street platinum
It was 2 Live Florida crews caught heat for rappin'
But free speech pollination kept bees colonizing in hives
And stung Delores Tucker right in her pride
The Tribes ocean splash was rising the tide
Strictly 4 My Niggas that were ready to die in the ride
I wish the summer's vibe could've lasted forever
To bad we had to have a change in that weather that shit was beautiful

By the dawn of the new millennium we saw bright chains
Winter brought along platinum causing the ice age
Now we got rap cats stealing classic rap tracks
In winter it's snowed in like the temperature's below ten
Citizens open up shows for more snowmen
Scrawny boys rock bubblegooses to pose like grown men
And you can catch freezer burn from women when they show skin
Jolly fat white men get paid when rap hits the shelves
And artists themselves get treated like Elves
Matter of fact Santa's gotten so greedy when a rapper sells
You even need clearance to sample Jingle Bells
What the hell You need cells and 2 ways for chicks to bone ya 
And so much ice on ya body that you can get pneumonia
Even at the beaches of Daytona it's gotten colder
But it's about time for the cycle to start over 
How we gon' start it 
Oh yeah it's time they come down

Butterfly in the sky I can fly twice as high

He said Fuck to sobriety death to the worker bees
Thirteen circles I've stepped for eternity
Burning purple stressed on a murder spree
It's self-inflicted don't get it twisted
These knives in my back now Elliott Smith 
Rides in the background melodies fit 
Mixed with the misfits fix is the hurt
When the lips that I kiss with press to the dirt
French-kiss vixens distant and cursed
Burned bridges occurred from scriptin' my words
Word so I'll chisel a verse
On these lie-filled halls that I've lived in and searched
I'm still lost in a head of catacombs
'Cause I build walls like I'm Edgar Allan Poe
I've killed off every damsel that I know
For castles that I keep castles that I know

I'm having spirits in the dark laying under moonlight
Laughing with a stranger like I saved her from her doomed life
Pop a couple Percs a perk of anonymity
Trapped within a curse that I created with my energy
A path that I rehearse a cycle on repeat
Life is like a lion and I'm dying at its feet
I roll another sweet check my muted Treo
I've seen them as the plot too busy caught up in the B-roll
My eye up to the keyhole scared to turn the knob
And go out on my own instead I blend in with the mob
My memory bank's the only thing I tend to rob
And every time I phone the lob I'm out of dodge
It's hard on the boulevard and other cliches
The type of bullshit that I'm feeding self these days
Corrosion on my relays one thing my mirrors chose
An imp in new clothes exposed

I mow a dead lawn aim for the alpha
Ten claws deck the halls of Valhalla
Not a man a receptacle for crest-fallen matter
Never tempered or pressed into patterns
But just won't die instead a palpitation from the plasma
Pumping disenchanting anecdotes and antiquated data at 'em
I get these headaches that climb down into my stomach
Then off into my extremities and out into the public
In a flood of shadow puppetry something in the air
Got a tiny pool of energy becoming self-aware
It's recognizing family and alphanumeric characters
Scenery and deities with unassuming avatars
Close encounters exacerbate his condition
From classy to a bastion of classic misdirection
Tune into the Casio adventures
When the rest of me can barely form a god-damn sentence
You can only see the stars when it's Don Cheadle black
When the chips are down who dips and who reacts 
Folding under pressure ain't get us to where we at
When all hope's lost you battle to get it back
In fact dark times are when heroes shine
Without them sour grapes there would be no wine
Let your ego dine adversity for breakfast
Zero pride in settling for less then
Fighting tooth and nail no matter who prevails
Instead of wishing on a star grab a comet by the tail
Your ship ain't coming in then you got to make a sale
Catch the wind and make it sail and hit the ground runnin'
Til ya heartbeat sound like a battle drum thumpin'
Those talking about failure ain't talkin' about nothin'
You may weather the storm if you don't stop punchin'
Reach for the stars and you might just touch 'em

Stars shine stars shine
When you think you've lost your way
Making for a brighter day a brighter day
Stars shine stars shine
Coming out to light the way
Making for a brighter day a brighter day

Our money's funny our change is strange
These days ain't sunny and the sea ain't tame
We playing games where the rules ain't clearly defined
In this coffee black world knee deep in the grind
Be a vine in the shade a salmon in a stream
Try lookin' for the stars when examining your dreams
Could go from street singers to pop figures
From block niggas to a brotha that is followin' stock tickers
To grow in the night you gotta create light
Gotta be a gamma ray burst that erase sight
No astronomer has seen your incredible gleam
And you don't need a telescope to detect dream
You blessed with a mind that can see through space
On dark nights in the stars you can find your face
Just look up and marvel at all the constellations
Egyptians built pyramids from these creations

Against all odds and against the grain
Sun becomes shelter in the midst of rain
In monsoon proportions them moments of importance
When victory's in vain it's the same the blood coursing
Of course when selfishness inside provides poison
Apply it to your life and let it sink in like ointment
Poised when them black clouds come around don't back down
Let haters be theme music playin' in the background

There was a time when I couldn't find energy
The only person that was feelin' me was Mrs. Hennessy
It's like life was pinnin' me down
I used to go out on the town and get instantly clowned
You ain't gonna be a rapper you're not a factor
You just a Kentucky boy get yourself a tractor
Chasing out the bogus dreams that you never achieve
That's when the liquor and weed became a need
Self-esteem was lower than snorkel cities
Aspirations were about as big as Myrtle Urkel's titties
Then as soon as I started getting some pride
My sister hydroplaned and died on water boarding
In a family full of pride house full of tears
Spent many years with a blood stream full of beers
Heart full of fears all jeers no cheers
'til the rhythm in my ears make my mind clear

I shine in spaces where time is just a glare
Yeah hold the mic like it's a memory

I hold the microphone enclosed in my palm
And go beyond the flows exposed in my songs
Can't grow fond of past memories
'Cause negativity leads the way to live with vast energy
Offended by the mental imagery
And suggest livin' in poverty was really meant for me
Paternal tendencies towards chemical dependencies
Had me thinking that all my enemies were kin to me
I can't begin to see how to control the flash backs
Progress past and my style of dress got me laughed at
Thought I was passed that but it attempts to reoccur
When I don't perceive what I feel I deserve
Being slurred by those not livin' in my position
My thoughts tend to glisten just like a pot to piss in
And when I thought I'd risen life freezes the frame
So I hold the mic like a memory to ease the pain

I sit back and reflect on the wild paths in my life
Only pain and heartache can feel my paths on the right
You know what blasphemy's like cursing at God
'Cause you ain't got shit it hurts and it's hard
Hell at times I stepped it up to only stumble
Was forced to play Tarzan in this concrete jungle
Most of my life's a daze got me forever lighting haze
Tryna forget the times where I barely ate twice a day
For alone and helpless so when I only felt the shame
Sharing a twin bed in a homeless shelter
Few friends even then most homies is fake
Feel like a prisoner in my home pencil my only escape
I went from the block with my fam to college exams
But the pressures still there dog I'm still scared
But I know it will all be right in the end
As long as I can focus my fears and channel my life through my pen

It's four o-clock on a Sunday morning
Who the hell is calling my phone 
Waking me up I'm stretching and yawning
If you had any sense you'd leave me alone

Wee hours of the morning and word is bond
I'm in jail I need bail
Again the word is bond
Not James in a tux with olives draped on my cup
With a dame all on me with healthy letters to cup
Can you free me before my prints get back
And they run em through the system and realize that I'm black
All I remember was the stripper then I faded to rack
Said her name was December than she sat on my lap
Liquor and higher power my witness
I thought fleeing The People was just a matter of fitness
With all these nice drinks compliments of Dennis
Whoever the fuck that is
Dennis tab maxed out on titties and fifths
Whoever the fuck Dennis is Dennis is pissed 
Cus I don't think that dude we was drinking with was Dennis at all fam

Im aware it's four in the morning
But I just wanna tell you im drunk and im kinda horny
I know it gets annoying but I been losing my grip
Every woman I talk to I treat like a fair piss and it's a bitch
Mainly 'cause I now consider you one
I wanna let you go but every time I seem to screw up
Now that's the problem with the space that you occupy
It's going great and then the thought of you would cross my mind
A box of wine and a carton of coffin nails will
Convince me now would be a great time for hate mailin'
Remember me We were dating and you slept with my friends
I just thought that I'd remind you in case you ever forget it
And train yourself to believe that you're not a terrible wretch
You broke my heart into like a million pieces
So here's another dim-litted picture of my penis

What the fuck is going on Grieves
You saved my number under the wrong name in your phone 
Is that a picture of your  
I'ma pretend I didn't see that
All that rain got you suicidal up in Seattle
You had to much to drink again
Whiskey and a cellphone ain't never gonna be your friend
You booze you lose homie you been warned
You better off using your cellphone to watch porn
Grab some lotion and a napkin
Jack off then pass out
All these drunk texts'll have you fucked off and ass out
I hope you black out before you do anymore damage
I checked your timeline homie why you Tweetin in Spanish
I understand if this is what you gotta go through
But when you sober up I got some screenshots to show you
Grieves bro trust me
And you gonna be hella happy that all of them texts didn't go through

She do the damn thing
Fine as champagne
Hot and the way that she trot
She only fan flames
A Super Freak but please don't call this man James
If she put it on me bet a nigga pull a hamstring
The type of strange that makes you forget your name
Amnesia to a player she makes you forget your game
She got me caught up like an alley oop
I can ride at Sally's like a jockey but she got me spooked
I'm feeling like a youth but
To tell you the truth though
I do wanna crush
It's A little more than lust
Trust me I'm no Goodyear gimp
But she got me stumped
Lookin' Bubba Gump tryna Shrimp
I was a pimp bitch
Mixed with modern day Romeo
But today my pimp look more like Polio
Overdosed off of beauty got me comatose
Shorty so blessed makes the Reverend catch a holy ghost

They just sparkle and they twinkle and I'm hypnotized
Her stare cut through and I'm hypnotized

The way her booty sway got me caught up in a daze
Wish it was maze I'd get lost in it for days
'Cause I be so amazed when it's jiggling in waves
Her body so sweet I bet she sweat glaze
I'm long as three shoes when I'm staring at her boobs
But I be swimming in a gaze and made my inner tubes
They keep me so amused
Like two new Rubik's Cubes
Twins so perfect so easy to confuse
Her stare is therapy for me forgetting all my problems
I'm victim to a vixen when swishin' in apple bottoms
Switching my position trying to sit where I can spot em
Right there in my line of view
And then she caught me but she smiled like she was so amused
Your girl is right behind you fool
Snapped me out of it
Kinda slapped me out of it
Hypnotism is my prison someone get me out of it

They just sparkle and they twinkle and I'm hypnotized
Her stare cut through and I'm hypnotized

She said he name was Gwendolyn
The only reason I remember it is 'cause it rhymes with pendulum
And that's the way her hips were swayin'
Otherwise I can't recall a word her lips were sayin'
Damn it y'all I'm mesmerize
Her eyes they got me hypnotized
She got me shaking my head
But I ain't saying no
Lookin' her up and down but I ain't nodding yes
I see her mouth movin'
I think my mouths open
Hope I don't start droolin'
Shit is in slow motion
I gotta say somethin' nice
Snap out of it player okay
Time to focus
Did you just pinch yourself
'Cause you'se a dream come true
I grew an inch myself comin' up with things to do
Oh shit she didn't slap me
Fuck it didn't happen
I just imagined that yeah shit I blew it y'all
Where'd she go I can't believe it
I hate to see her go
But love to watch her leavin'

They just sparkle and they twinkle and I'm hypnotized
Her stare cut through and I'm hypnotized
Put her out in the cold didn't want her close to he
'Cause his granddaughter's different than she suppose to be
Diluted her genes it stopped the music it seemed
That they'd only seen polluted stream and that wasn't clean
Said he could almost no longer stand the breath
From this pure horror more worse than Amittyville
So what's next Don't answer me yield 
This is a normal occurrence not something randomly real
Ain't even allowed visits over a child's pigment
Hard times baby daddy grinds to support
His mother and a few other friends privately in her fort
For short stays ya know but more aid was needed
Baby is like a year and a half now and speaking
More than I can say about that man with his child
They can't even come face to face and share smiles
Raining pure pain on her life by staying distant
Like she spawned a fucking anti-Christ or a Satan infant
Blatant mentions about family blood won't leave
Love's her deeply but evil sends it's opposite feed
Too ever set in his ways to ever relate
If he could just set it aside there'd be heaven to pay
Then weathered and aged time swept him to grave
Love conquers all shit I'd say that areas grey

Old fashioned people they never know why 

Most don't even know why they believe what they believe man
Never taking a second to look at life
Bad water in our seeds y'all still growing weeds dawg
In the dark walls blocking all that light
Most don't even know why they believe what they believe man
Never taking a second to look at life
Bad water in our seeds y'all still growing weeds dawg in the dark

Looking at life in retrospect it's hard to regret
Stuck in your ways 'cause hatred is hard to forget
Niggas talk all religious trying to barter with death
Parts of the flesh wrinkle up while you start to reflect
And even though nobody's life is ever perfect
You start to wonder if all the pain was really worth it
Pondering the purpose of living the curse that was given
Dreaming about freedom and escaping the prison
People who pimp children are really raping religion
The matrix is fiction placed in a vision
But now the technology follows me solemnly
Building the future laws to my philosophy
Alzheimer's cutting through like a lobotomy
Not even the golden arthritis of king Midas
Could buy comfort and peace for the righteous
I survived disease and political crisis
By backstabbing gnomes that are now lifeless
And now I live vicariously through my kids
Like people who love the sport but can't play for shit
Fighting glaucoma front the cops taking a hit
I slip into a coma roaming over the planet
Leaving the gold and the granite the old and the famished
But just before I vanish as I think I'm at the end
The sun becomes the light of my birth and I live again

Old fashioned people they never know why
The world is changing day to day
It moves so fast and leaves them in another time
Close your eyes you will see

Cringed in the back of a van with no sleep
Trying to make a good impression with my mic in my hand
I feel weathered but feel like I've been driving forever
Showin' up to rock show or trying to hold myself together
I've been better but all things pass
This life is taking everything away but you're provided with your past
So fuck it I stick to having dreams on the road
But until this dream is done I'm gonna keep my eyes closed
And breathe when it snows
Breathe when I'm forced to live a life with a person on a phone
Tied down to things I chose and fight the parallel of love every time I gotta pack up and go and keep breathin'
Leave with the seasons
Breathe and let the blue lights hit me on the stage when I am speaking
'Cause after the show when the last star shines
I can make this all better when I close my eyes

I'm in another zone where troubles gone
Where sisters home and my bro leaves that stuff alone
A place where life is easy for everybody else
I wish that Earth was Eden and I put that on myself
But we don't know it where we don't show it all
For life ain't protocol under sky over law

I'm in another space where all the food is good
And there's enough for everybody in my neighborhood
Where all the grass is blue where we don't know 'bout green
'Cause money ain't a thing I pinch myself it's not a dream
Where human form and uniform are unicorn it seems
If I drew a horn in cuneiform it wouldn't mean a thing

Close your eyes an you will see

Between climbing and finding it not worth it
Locked in a rhythm my timing is perfect
I'm so zoned out of my mind I spit verses blind
I think of home when I close my eyes
So done with the smokes and fries
Gas stations with clerks who never seen a Filipino in his life
Drinks I shouldn't drink things I never write
Cities I never liked now it's like aight
Got merch table weirdos bros who want to cypher
Girls who want to fuck but not vice versa
My work is love no complaints I'm fine
Its been a long night can't wait to close my eyes

I dream of an industry ego-less
And free from the modern chains with these chains we're so deep in love
Manufacture buzz bought just to keep us up
Dreaming a publicist wasn't 2 G's a month
And where it's not about numbers and math
And I was content with really just a couple of fans
And my happiness wasn't relying on tours and a van
Merch sales iTunes MySpace and a band
With the front row stadium packed
And those that never gave me a chance I could throw it right back
Look at me now look at me man
Defeated myself as I ran circles around a track
Kept running and gunning success in my path
Fuck being humble humility is a step in the past
I woke up and realized it was a dream
Wide awake in the rap game but life I'm asleep
You pretend to be dying to get a part of my mind
I been once inclined to tell you pardon my spyin
Part of my shine comes from the distance
You are from a star while you compiling your wishlist
Is this business emotionally invested 
Or built from the sweat of our flesh pressed against it
Love is war sex is a weapon
The mind is a mine so watch where you're steppin'
Thoughts that are kept in wet dreams covered in face cream
Come to fruition in positions used to make steam
Feelings are just filling in this half-baked scene
Then see everything she got she not shy
Our love below so dro we most high
Then wears off when what we wear's on
Again I turn away when what we share's gone

If this is not the hardest part then I wanna part
Before it gets too deep
If passion dies within routine then I'll come clean

Lovin' ain't easy when you running scared
Could have been fearless and unprepared

Under the twilight and we living the Miller Highlife
La Petite Mort my lady we bout to die twice
I won't' surrender and you won't surrender yurn
Whatever happens after this moment's of no concern
But it's hard to stop the burn when you fueled by the friction
Increased heart rate only confused my addiction
We wired for desire dangers to ourselves
Flying under the radar in the hangers with the stealths
My muse sleeps deep within time
I go to her for credit though I need to decline
It's easy to cross a line and blame ya flesh for the crime
I'm sorry it's just the way we designed
My dear we should leave here I'm talking bout one at a time though
'Cause you got me changin' my mind slow
Leave here says that voice in the back of my spine
As I awake and the moment rewinds
Yeah I know it gets hard
But we made it this far
And we never gonna stop
Even when we reach the top of our dreams

I'm tryna reach the top of my dreams
That's why I'm mapping out the script
And slowly plottin' my scenes
They never get the picture
Even when they're watchin' that screen
That's why they underestimate me 'cause I'm not what I seem
I'm quite different  entirely focused on making wise decisions
I'd rather risk a huge mistake than spend my life wishin'
I try to deal with every problem with the right vision
'Cause when you're gone it's just that coffin that you lie stiff in
Six feet under makes me wonder
If I could go back in time and try to fix each blunder
That I made when I was younger way before the hunger
Before these groupie broads was tryna save a brother number
See I'm achievin' every part of my goals
And I'mma stay the same no matter how far that I go
I think bright even though inside I'm dark and I'm cold
Feel the pain in my heart and my soul but I'm livin' my dreams

At last rap has it's Dr. Parnassus for the masses
Living a dream with a atlas as my mattress
Living a dream 'cause the rent is fantastic
Haters get evicted on a daily basis
Middle finger notice waved in their faces
Let the door hit em where the good Lord split 'em
Video game players you missing the big picture
Get a million inch screen let your dream be seen
The world is a stage let your dream be scene
Backdrop and props for the finer things
Enjoy the spice of life on your fries and wings
And wash it down with something imported
If domestic ain't the best at making you feel important
Aim high poppin' bottles will get boring
I can have Caviar dreams and Champagne wishes
Or a catfish sandwich with Champagne the stripper no it's my dream

Claim a victory for entering this world earth
Then play your symphony from city to the rural dirt
Beyond hurt invert your neural confines
I hit the lines like I'm running in the combine
Intramural of the money drink ya night caps
Dream big nigga play that shit in full screen
My dream theater's a perpetual climax
Make miracles give me water I'll give you wine back
The troops in Iraq Haitians in the Carib
Or my Arabs who keep the faith and wear it like a scarab
Dreams prepare ya' for living they hold the key to life
Gotta be the sheriff when you have 'em try to read 'em right
Don't be impressed by things
That haunt ya' when you sleep at night
Just rise above it right in public catch an eagle flight
Tap that passion that's within ya and just let it breath
I heard it whisper words of wisdom would ya let it be
Please  Let it be
You try to get success directly
But there is one to destroy us
Sometimes the way is of need
Perhaps you may get ignorant

Do I gotta get ign'ant and show my pigment on the job
Slap the darkest part of my hand across jaws
These days and times with jobs hard to find
You gotta work a salt mine or work an assault 9
Most folks barely staying afloat through proper channels
And think the rich sit with black candles and slaughter mammals
And run the globe with mind control and designer sandals
But life's a skinny bitch it's a struggle to get a handle
I'm about to just break bad like Malcolm's dad
Be Meth Boyardee with a lab and a yellow cab
So I can get my picket fenceand and yellow lab
That American Dream makes me wake up and scream
That consist of old money buying shiny new things
That I'm about to break as I'm creating a scene
You can use as an anthem for Kanye's tantrums
'Cause I'm about a thumb and a finger away from snapping damn
